He explains that those who made the Transformers, the ""Creators,"" want Optimus back. Before leaving, Lockdown gives Cemetery Wind a powerful relic called the Seed, which when detonated transforms living things into transformium and cyberforms wide areas of land, giving the Autobots time to board the ship. Cade and Shane save Tessa and escape with Bumblebee and Crosshairs while Hound and Drift escape with Optimus on a detachable part of Lockdown\'s ship. Optimus and Brains reveal that Galvatron is the reincarnated Megatron who has manipulated KSI to steal the Seed and rebuild the Decepticons.

As a young girl, she befriends and falls in love with a human <a href=""/wiki/Peasant"" title=""Peasant"">peasant</a> boy named Stefan (Michael Higgins), whose affection for Maleficent is overshadowed by his ambition to become king. As the two grow older, they become estranged, and Maleficent becomes protector of the Moors. When King Henry (<a href=""/wiki/Kenneth_Cranham"" title=""Kenneth Cranham"">Kenneth Cranham</a>) tries to conquer the Moors, Maleficent (<a href=""/wiki/Angelina_Jolie"" title=""Angelina Jolie"">Angelina Jolie</a>) commands primeval forces and makes him retreat.

Instead, he uses a chain made of iron, which burns fairies, to cut off Maleficent\'s wings which he then presents to the dying king as evidence of her death. Devastated by Stefan\'s betrayal, a now wingless and hate-filled Maleficent declares herself Queen of the Moors, turning it into a dark and oppressive realm. Diaval (<a href=""/wiki/Sam_Riley"" title=""Sam Riley"">Sam Riley</a>), a <a href=""/wiki/Raven"" title=""Raven"">raven</a> she has saved and to whom she sometimes gives human or other forms, acts as her wings, spy, and confidant.</p>', u'<p>Some time later, Diaval informs Maleficent that Stefan (who is now king) is hosting a christening for his newborn daughter, Princess Aurora, with his wife, Queen Leila (<a href=""/wiki/Hannah_New"" title=""Hannah New"">Hannah New</a>). Bent on revenge, Maleficent crashes the event and curses the infant princess: on her 16th birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel, putting her into a deep sleep from which she will never awaken. When Stefan begs for mercy, Maleficent offers an antidote: The curse can be broken by true love\'s kiss. Stefan sends Aurora to live with the three pixies - Knotgrass (<a href=""/wiki/Imelda_Staunton"" title=""Imelda Staunton"">Imelda Staunton</a>), Thistlewit (<a href=""/wiki/Juno_Temple"" title=""Juno Temple"">Juno Temple</a>), and Flittle (<a href=""/wiki/Lesley_Manville"" title=""Lesley Manville"">Lesley Manville</a>) - until the day after her 16th birthday, while he destroys all the spinning wheels in the kingdom and hides them in the castle dungeon. He sends his soldiers to hunt and kill Maleficent, but she surrounds the Moors with an impenetrable wall of thorns. As the years go by, King Stefan descends into madness in his obsession with killing Maleficent, and even refuses to see his wife, Queen Leila, who is on her deathbed.</p>', u'<p>Despite her initial dislike for Aurora, Maleficent begins to care for the girl when the neglectful pixies fail to do so. When Aurora (<a href=""/wiki/Elle_Fanning"" title=""Elle Fanning"">Elle Fanning</a>) is 15, she encounters Maleficent and calls her ""<a href=""/wiki/Fairy_godmother"" title=""Fairy godmother"">fairy godmother</a>"", revealing she was always aware someone watched over her. Realizing she has grown fond of the princess, Maleficent attempts to revoke the curse, but she cannot since she stated ""No power on earth can change it"" when she first cast the curse. Aurora later meets a young prince named Phillip (<a href=""/wiki/Brenton_Thwaites"" title=""Brenton Thwaites"">Brenton Thwaites</a>), and the two are instantly enamored with each other. Diaval thinks it must be true love and the key to lifting the curse, but Maleficent reveals that this supposed antidote was a mere trick on her part as true love doesn\'t exist. On the day before Aurora\'s 16th birthday, Maleficent, hoping to avoid the curse, invites her to live in the Moors. When the pixies inadvertently tell Aurora of her parentage and of Maleficent\'s true identity, a horrified Aurora runs away to her mother and her father\'s castle.</p>', u'<p>After a brief reunion with Aurora, Stefan locks her away in her room for safety. However, she is drawn by the curse to the dungeon and pricks her finger on the spindle of the spinning wheel and she falls into a deep sleep, completing the curse. Intent on saving her, Maleficent and Diaval manage to get Phillip to her room. Phillip kisses Aurora, but she does not awaken. Alone in Aurora\'s chamber, Maleficent apologizes to Aurora, swears that no harm will come to her, and kisses her forehead. To her surprise, this breaks the spell, as Maleficent\'s motherly concern for Aurora constitutes true love. Aurora forgives Maleficent and they attempt to leave the castle, but Maleficent is trapped in an iron net and attacked by Stefan and his guards. Maleficent transforms Diaval into a <a href=""/wiki/Dragon"" title=""Dragon"">dragon</a> and he lifts the net off her, but is driven back by the guards. Stefan beats and taunts Maleficent, but before he can kill her, Aurora frees Maleficent\'s wings; they fly back to her and reattach themselves.

Blinded by hatred, Stefan attempts once more to kill her, but falls off the tower to his death.</p>', u'<p>Soon after, Aurora is crowned queen of the human and fairy realms by Maleficent, unifying the two kingdoms, with Phillip beside her.

The remaining humans in San Francisco, who are genetically immune to the virus, are living in a guarded and unfinished high-rise tower within the ruined city. Prompted by Koba, a scarred <a href=""/wiki/Bonobo"" title=""Bonobo"">bonobo</a> who holds a grudge against humans for his mistreatment, Caesar brings an army of apes to the city tower where he conveys the message that while the apes do not want war, they will fight to defend their home.

While looking for medical supplies, Malcolm encounters Blue Eyes; disenchanted with Koba\'s leadership, the young ape spares Malcolm\'s life and returns to the house with him, where he reconciles with his father. Caesar grows nostalgic watching a video clip from his childhood of his former owner and father figure Will Rodman on his old <a href=""/wiki/Camcorder"" title=""Camcorder"">camcorder</a> as Malcolm learns of Caesar\'s past. A plan is put into action: Blue Eyes returns to the tower and frees the caged humans and apes loyal to Caesar, then Malcolm leads the apes, unseen, into the tower from below.

A bag of the drug is forcibly sewn into her abdomen and that of three other drug mules who will also transport the drug for sale in Europe. While Lucy is in captivity, one of her captors kicks her in the abdomen, breaking the bag and releasing a large quantity of the drug into her system.

The museum has a new wax figure <a href=""/wiki/Neanderthal"" title=""Neanderthal"">Neanderthal</a> resembling Larry named Laaa. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that his tablet is corroding, which has adverse effects on the exhibits; they go berserk during the event, causing panic. Larry berates the exhibits, and goes home to find his son Nicky throwing a party. Nicky isn\'t so sure about college and wants to take a year off to plan his own future.</p>', u'<p>Larry discovers that former night watchman Cecil Fredericks was the boy who found the tablet in 1938. Larry reunites with Cecil and tells him about the tablet deteriorating. Cecil realizes that the locals\' warning that ""the end will come\u201d meant that the tablet\'s magic would end. He mentions that Ahkmenrah\'s parents were sent to the <a href=""/wiki/British_Museum"" title=""British Museum"">British Museum</a>.

He eventually yields to Larry\'s request, and pretends that he is still director.</p>', u'<p>Larry and Nicky travel to the museum. The security guard Tilly lets them in.

Dexter, who Larry sent to find them, appears and stops the volcano\'s flow to save them.</p>', u'<p>The gang finds Ahkmenrah\u2019s parents, and his father, Merenkahre, reveals the tablet was meant to keep his family together forever and is endowed with the power of <a href=""/wiki/Khonsu"" title=""Khonsu"">Khonsu</a>, god of the moon, and needs frequent exposure to moonlight to retain its magic. If the tablet doesn\'t get moonlight exposure soon, it will die, and so will the exhibits. Lancelot steals the tablet, then leaves to find his Lady <a href=""/wiki/Guinevere"" title=""Guinevere"">Guinevere</a>. The gang splits up to find Lancelot, but Tilly locks Larry and Laaa in the employee break room until Laaa head-butts the door open. The gang leaves the museum to continue the search while Laaa stays behind to keep Tilly detained, during which, they become attracted to each other. The <a href=""/wiki/Trafalgar_Square"" title=""Trafalgar Square"">Trafalgar Square</a> lion statues corner them; Larry distracts the statues with his flashlight and the search continues.</p>', u'<p>They catch up with Lancelot at a <i><a href=""/wiki/Camelot_(musical)"" title=""Camelot (musical)"">Camelot</a></i> <a href=""/wiki/Musical_theatre"" title=""Musical theatre"">musical</a>, starring <a href=""/wiki/Hugh_Jackman"" title=""Hugh Jackman"">Hugh Jackman</a> as <a href=""/wiki/King_Arthur"" title=""King Arthur"">King Arthur</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Alice_Eve"" title=""Alice Eve"">Alice Eve</a> as Guinevere, chasing him to the roof. By now, the New York exhibits are dying. Lancelot, realizing the quest was about them, hands over the tablet; Larry readjusts it and the moon restores it, reviving the exhibits. Back at the museum, the New York exhibits decide that Ahkmenrah and his tablet belong there, even though that means they will no longer come to life at night. As the others leave, Lancelot reveals he has tamed the Triceratops skeleton from earlier, and Larry tells Tilly that tomorrow night she will have the best job ever. After returning to New York, Larry spends a final few moments with the exhibits before sunrise.</p>', u""<p>Three years later, Larry has given up his job as a night watchman to become a teacher, and a traveling British Museum exhibition comes to the museum. Tilly gives the tablet to Dr. McPhee, whose job Larry had saved by taking the blame for the chaos at the Hayden Planetarium reopening. She shows him that all the exhibits have come to life because of the tablet's power and are partying in the museum.

He returns to Persia and declares war on Greece to avenge his father.</p>', u'<p>As Xerxes\' forces advance towards Thermopylae, Themistocles meets with the council and convinces them to provide him with a fleet to engage the Persians at the sea. Themistocles (the Athenian general) then travels to Sparta to ask King Leonidas for help, but is informed by Dilios that Leonidas is consulting the Oracle, and Gorgo is reluctant to side with Athens. Themistocles later reunites with his old friend Scyllas, who infiltrated the Persian troops and learned Artemisia was born Greek, but defected to Persia as her family was raped and murdered by Greek <a href=""/wiki/Hoplite"" title=""Hoplite"">hoplites</a> and she was taken as a sex slave, and subsequently left for dead in the streets. She was rescued and adopted by a Persian emissary. Her lust for vengeance gained the attention of King Darius and he made her a naval commander after she killed many of his enemies.

A group of male youths greet him in a large grassy area called the Glade that is enclosed by tall, stone walls. Every month, a new boy and supplies arrive in the elevator. The boys, who call themselves Gladers, have formed a rudimentary society with each assuming specialized tasks. Alby, their leader and the first to arrive in the Glade, says every boy eventually recalls his name, but none remember their past. The boy learns that a vast Maze surrounding the Glade may provide the only way out. During the day, designated Runners search the Maze for an escape route, returning before nightfall when the entrance closes. No one has ever survived a night inside the Maze.</p>', u""<p>While in a competition with another boy, named Captain Gally, the boy suddenly remembers his name is Thomas. The next day, Thomas is attacked by Ben, a Runner delirious from being stung by a Griever \u2013 deadly techno-organic creatures that roam the Maze at night. Ben is forced into the Maze and left to die as there is no cure for what the Griever infected him with. Minho, the lead Runner, and Alby later retrace Ben's steps inside the Maze. Minho reappears at dusk dragging Alby, who is stung, but they are unable to reach the closing entrance in time. Thomas spontaneously runs into the Maze to help but all three are trapped. During the night in the Maze, Thomas and Minho tie Alby up high on the Maze wall to hide him from the Grievers, but Minho abandons Thomas when a Griever emerges from the center of the Maze. Thomas slides under the Maze wall, managing to hide from a Griever. Later, Thomas finds Minho and his actions during the night keeps them alive, and he kills a Griever by tricking it into a narrow, closing passageway thus causing it to be crushed, making him the first to ever survive a night in the Maze and kill a Griever. To the other boys' astonishment, they return the next morning.</p>"", u'<p>The next morning, the first-ever girl arrives in the elevator. She apparently recognizes Thomas though he cannot remember her. A note says that ""She is the last one ever"". Thomas, Minho, Frypan, Winston, and Zart enter the Maze. They locate the Griever corpse and remove a beeping mechanical device from inside it. Gally claims Thomas has jeopardized the fragile peace between the Gladers and the Grievers and wants him punished, but Newt, the group\'s second-in-command, instead designates Thomas a Runner. Minho shows Thomas a scale model of the Maze he has built, based on his three years of exploration. The Maze\'s numbered sections open and close in a regular sequence that might be a code. The device is numbered to correspond to a certain section within the Maze. With the mechanical device, they may be able to find an escape route.</p>', u'<p>The girl, Teresa, has two syringes filled with an unknown substance. One is used on Alby, and he gradually recovers from the Griever sting and begins regaining his memories. Minho and Thomas venture back into the Maze and discover a possible exit but are nearly trapped, barely making it back to the Glade.</p>', u'<p>That night, the Maze entrance does not close while others open, letting Grievers pour in. A massacre ensues as the Gladers, practically defenseless against the Grievers, struggle to fight back or hide. Zart, and several others are killed during the attack. Thomas is assaulted by Gally after the chaos, who blames him for everything that has happened. Thomas, who has had disconnected memory flashes since arriving, stabs himself with a severed Griever stinger in an attempt to revive his memory. The others inject him with the last anti-venom. Unconscious, he recalls that he and Teresa worked for the organization that created the Maze, W.I.C.K.E.D.

The survivors (Thomas, Teresa, Newt, Minho, Chuck, Frypan, Winston, and a few others) eventually enter a laboratory strewn with dead scientists and technicians.

Delirious from a Griever sting, he insists they must stay in the Maze, then aims at Thomas intending to kill him in revenge for the Glade\'s destruction. Minho kills Gally with a spear, but not before Chuck is fatally shot protecting Thomas, who is devastated by his friend\'s death. Masked armed men rush in and take the group to a helicopter.

However, Hammond is texted by the unknown person who says that he knows what is in Hammond\'s briefcase. As Marks confronts Hammond in the rear lavatory, the latter is revealed to be smuggling <a href=""/wiki/Cocaine"" title=""Cocaine"">cocaine</a> in a brief-case.

The passengers view a mid-flight news report via their television sets, saying that Marks is the hijacker of their flight. The hijacker\'s phone suddenly activates, warning that a bomb will explode in 30 minutes.

Marks persuades the passengers of his innocence, and together they move the bomb to the plane\'s rear and bury it with luggage to reduce the blast\'s damage and move to the front of the plane to avoid the blast. The plane has to descend to 8,000 feet, which is necessary for survival, as the low pressure of higher altitudes would rip the plane apart if the bomb exploded.

Throughout the film, it is not clearly established that Hercules is truly the son of Zeus, and many are skeptical of the claim as well as of the stories of Hercules\' famous Twelve Labors.

Later in the hall of the palace, Rhesus has been chained up and left on display, noticing that Ergenia has taken pity to him, Hercules confronts her and finds out Rhesus was telling the truth in that he was merely retaliating against Lord Cotys's aggressive attempts to expand his kingdom, and, although Ergenia doesn't agree with his methods, she goes along with them for the sake of her son Arius, Lord Cotys's successor to the throne, who is being threatened by Cotys.</p>"", u""<p>After receiving their reward, the mercenaries are ready to leave, but Hercules decides to stay behind to stop Cotys, and all but Autolycus choose to follow him.

Eurystheus reveals that he drugged Hercules the night his family died, viewing him as a threat to his power. Hercules's family was in fact killed by three vicious wolves sent by Eurystheus, resulting in Hercules's constant hallucinations of Cerberus. When Lord Cotys orders Ergenia to be executed for her betrayal, Hercules is encouraged by Amphiaraus to believe in himself just as everyone believes in him. In a show of inhuman strength, Hercules breaks free of his chains, saving Ergenia and slaying the wolves with his bare hands. Hercules releases the prisoners, including Rhesus, and then confronts King Eurystheus, impaling him with his own dagger.

Hercules again uses inhuman strength and pushes a massive statue of Hera from its foundations and uses it to crush Lord Cotys and many of his soldiers.

The surviving soldiers bow to Hercules, and Arius takes the throne, with Ergenia at his side, while Hercules and his men depart in search of other adventures.</p>', u'<p>As the credits roll, an animated retelling of the Twelve Labors shows how Hercules accomplished these feats with the help of his companions.</p>']"

Flint is taken to his father, and they and the foodimals all work together to allow Flint and Barry to infiltrate the Evil Corp building that is under construction on the island. Barry frees the trapped foodimals while Flint confronts Chester, who threatens to make food bars out of his friends. Chester makes numerous holograms of himself to overwhelm Flint, but Flint uses the Celebrationator to expose the real Chester, allowing Flint to rescue his friends.

Raleigh Becket first narrates how the first Kaiju, Trespasser, breached San Francisco in August 10, 2013 and destroyed three cities and the <a href=""/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge"" title=""Golden Gate Bridge"">Golden Gate Bridge</a> before the military destroyed it with three nuclear missiles. Hundun, the second Kaiju attacked and ravaged <a href=""/wiki/Manila"" title=""Manila"">Manila</a>, as the world thought it was an anomaly, until more Kaiju emerged from the Breach.</p>', u'<p>To fight them, the <a href=""/wiki/Pacific_Rim"" title=""Pacific Rim"">Pacific Rim</a> nations build the Jaegers, equally colossal humanoid war machines. Each Jaeger is controlled by two or more pilots whose brains are linked, called ""drifting"" to share the heavy mental load of operating the machine. The Jaegers are initially effective, but many are destroyed as the Kaijus grow more powerful and their attacks become more frequent.</p>', u""<p>In 2020,Raleigh and his brother Yancy Becket, are instructed to suit up to fight a Kaiju labeled Knifehead, a designated category III in danger and size. They wade out into the Pacific in their Jaeger, Gipsy Danger, with orders to kill the Kaiju and save the city. They are told to ignore the small fishing boat, Saltchuck that is in the middle of the battle. Raleigh ignores the command, and attempts to save the ship. He and Yancy believe they are victorious after shooting Knifehead with the plasma cannon built into the right arm, and prepare to leave. Knifehead reappears and attacks as the Jaeger is turned, ripping off Gipsy Danger's left arm, and causing Raleigh permanent damage. Knifehead then attacks the head, ripping it open and killing Yancy. Raleigh pilots the Jaeger solo, killing Knifehead, but receiving severe damage to Gipsy Danger in the process. He limped the Jaeger ashore on the Alaskan coast, much to the amazement of a father and son who witness the event. Raliegh emerges from the broken hull of Gipsy Danger dazed and bloodied before falling to the ground unconscious while the father sends his son off to get medical help. Traumatized by the sudden loss of his brother while still mentally connected to him, Raleigh quits the Jaeger Program.</p>"", u'<p>In 2025, the participating governments deem the Jaeger program unsustainable and discontinue and decommission it in favor of building defensive coastal walls, collectively called the Kaiju Wall. The four remaining Jaegers are redeployed to <a href=""/wiki/Hong_Kong"" title=""Hong Kong"">Hong Kong</a> to protect the coast until the walls are completed. Jaeger commander Marshall Stacker Pentecost resolves to make a last-ditch attempt to end the Kaiju threat by destroying The Breach with a <a href=""/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"" title=""Nuclear weapon"">nuclear weapon</a>, even though past nuclear strikes on the portal have been unsuccessful. Stacker plans to follow through with the initial Jaeger objective, regardless of the lack of funding. He flies to the Kaiju Wall, where Raleigh has been working for the past five years. Raleigh and the other workers are watching the news, which shows the Wall failing and a Kaiju named Mutavore attacking Sydney, Australia, before it\'s stopped by the Jaeger Striker Eureka, piloted by Herc and Chuck Hansen. Chuck asserts that the reason the Jaeger program failed was because of weak pilots. Stacker asks Raleigh to re-join the program, but he declines. He and his brother were still connected when he died and he cannot stand the mental pain another time. Stacker asks where he would rather die: building the Wall, ""or in a Jaeger,"" fighting Kaiju. Raliegh reluctantly returns to the Jaeger Program.</p>', u""<p>Raleigh travels to Hong Kong with Pentecost and begins the process of finding a new co-pilot.When they arrive in Hong Kong, they are greeted by Mako Mori, later revealed as Pentecost's adopted daughter and director of the Jaeger refurbishment project. She shows Raleigh around the Shatterdome. They get into an elevator with two scientists, Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb, who comprise the entire research team for the base. The Jaegers stationed in the Shatterdome are all the remaining mechs; Crimson Typhoon, which features three arms and is piloted by the Wei triplets. The second is called Cherno Alpha, piloted by a pair of Russians, Sasha and Aleksis Kaidonovsky. Herc and Chuck Hansen pilot the only Mark-5, Striker Eureka. Mako then shows Raleigh to Gipsy Danger, who has been rebuilt with additional weapons for the final mission. She then shows him to his room, right across from hers.</p>"", u""<p>Pentecost reluctantly allows Mako to participate in a test run with Raleigh. During the test, Mako relives the traumatic memory of the Kaiju attack (Onibaba) that orphaned her and nearly discharges <i>Gipsy Danger</i>\u200d\u200a'\u200bs weapons in the hangar. Pentecost deems her unfit for combat and grounds both her and Raleigh. She tells him that he will meet with the candidates for his partnership soon, and that she hopes to be a pilot one day. Her record is impressive, but she makes it clear that Stacker will not allow her to fight. She then goes to her room, but watches him from the door as he changes. In the mess hall, Raleigh is invited by Herc to sit with him and Chuck, but Chuck takes an instant dislike to Raleigh because he believes him to be weak, and fears that he will endanger their mission. Herc apologizes for his behavior, making it known that his son is a hothead and very impulsive. Stacker then goes to meet with the scientists. Gottleib tells him that, based on the data, they can expect a Double Event soon, and a triple soon afterward. Newton asserts that he believes he can connect with the Kaiju via Drift, the same as pilots in the Jaeger program do. Stacker dismisses him, telling him that it's impossible, and goes with Gottlieb's information instead.[5]</p>"", u""<p>Against his better judgement, Stacker appoints Mako as Raleigh's partner, and they do a test run in Gipsy Danger. Stacker is called away by a frightened Gottlieb, who tells him that Newton attempted the link anyway, and has collapsed in seizures on the floor. Chuck and Raleigh fight when Chuck insults Mako, but are broken up by Herc, while Raleigh and Mako go in to talk to Stacker. Stacker tells Mako that she is too inexperienced, and won't be piloting again, and Mako leaves. Raleigh strikes out at Stacker, saying that he knows why he won't let Mako fight, since he's been in her memories. The kaiju that was hunting Mako was killed by the Jaeger that Stacker piloted, and he took her under his wing after that. Raleigh says that he is only hindering Mako, but Stacker says that he has made up his mind.[</p>"", u""<p>A pair of Category IV Kaijus, codenamed Otachi and Leatherback are detected by Tendo attack Hong Kong. Striker Eureka, Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha are deployed to fend off the Kaiju. Herc and Chuck are supposed to remain back by the island as a last resort to avoid being damaged, while the Wei Tang triplets and the Kaidonovskys attack the two Kaiju. The Kaiju swiftly destroy Crimson Typhoon, prompting Herc and Chuck to assist. Striker Eureka arrives and joins the battle against Leatherback and Otachi, but not before the creatures overpower Cherno Alpha. Otachi then moved to attack Hong Kong. Leatherback triggers an EMP, disabling both Striker Eureka and the command center. Tendo says it will take two hours to get it all back online, so Stacker deploys Mako and Raleigh, as Gipsy Danger's nuclear core was unaffected by the EMP. They defeat Leatherback, saving the Hansens as well as Striker Eureka, though Herc breaks his arm after Leatherback lands a blow on the mech's head.</p>"", u'<p>Meanwhile, scientist Newton Geiszler creates a device that allows him to drift with a damaged Kaiju brain. He discovers that the Kaijus are not merely wild animals, but are <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Bioweapon"" title=""Bioweapon"">genetically engineered weapons</a>, hive-minded at the vanguard of an invading alien army called the Precursors. They came to Earth once before during the time of the Dinosaurs, but there was too much oxygen in the atmosphere and that the humans practically terraformed it for them. Stacker instructs Newton to do another link, with a fresh brain, which he can get from the black market dealer Hannibal Chau. Seeking more information, Pentecost orders Geiszler to repeat the experiment on an intact Kaiju brain and sends him to Hannibal Chau, a criminal who sells Kaiju body parts on the black market. When he finds him, he is astounded to see that Chau has equipment and specimens that even the government doesn\'t have. Newton tells Chau that he wants to establish another link, and Chau tells him that it\'s dangerous because now the Kaiju know where Newton is and will want to kill him. He dismisses Newton as Otachi storms the city, and Newton heads to a public Kaiju bunker.[5]</p>', u""<p>The bunker is attacked by Otachi, who breaks through the shelter's roof while searching. Gipsy Danger then attacks, and they fight through the city streets before Otachi flies up with Gipsy Danger in her clutches. Mako deploys Gipsy's sword, and they bisect Otachi before falling to the earth. Stacker reveals after they return that he is very ill, due to radiation poisoning from piloting the Mark-1 Coyote Tango. [5]</p>"", u""<p>Newton goes back to Chau's store, and demands the brain from the dead Kaiju. Chau relents, and he and his team go to harvest the parts from the carcass. Chau's men say that the second brain of the Otachi is damaged, but they hear a heartbeat, and Newton realizes that Otachi was pregnant. While running, Newton slips as the infant asphyxiates itself with its umbilical cord, only to eat Chau before finally dying.</p>"", u""<p>Stacker decides to put the final plan into motion early, knowing that they won't survive the triple attack Gottlieb predicted. The final plan is to go through the portal and destroy it with a high-yield nuclear bomb, so that the Kaiju can no longer get through. Gipsy Danger is supposed to run protection, giving enough time for Chuck and Herc to get through the portal to deploy the bomb. However, with Herc injured, and little time to find another pilot, Stacker decides to partner with Chuck, knowing that they could all die if he didn't.</p>"", u""<p>Herc and Chuck say goodbye to each other, knowing that Chuck will most likely not return. Meanwhile, Newton has decided to link with the newborn brain, and Gottlieb joins him. They realize that the plan will not work, and return to the base. When they get a hold of the two Jaegers, they tell them that the portal will only respond to the genetic code of a Kaiju, and that they must use a Kaiju or a part of one to get through the portal to destroy it, or else the bomb would deflect and only affect Earth. Geiszler and his lab partner Hermann Gottlieb link with the infant Kaiju's brain and learns that The Breach only opens for Kaiju DNA, which is why all previous attempts to destroy the portal have failed.</p>"", u'<p>The two remaining Jaegers commence their bombing run on The Breach. Pentecost volunteers to pilot <i>Striker Eureka</i>, which is the only one capable of carrying the bomb.The two Jaegers engage the Triple Event Kaiju - Scunner, Raiju and Slattern - with the latter the strongest of the three, the first Category V Kaiju as well as the largest ever encountered. Both Jaegers take heavy damage in the process.<i>Striker Eureka</i> is too damaged to release the bomb. Geiszler warns the two Jaegers that they must take a Kaiju into the Breach with them for the attack to succeed.Stacker and Chuck decide to deploy the bomb, sacrificing Striker and themselves to try and kill Scunner and Slattern to give Mako and Raleigh a chance to get through the portal. Pentecost and Chuck Hansen detonate the bomb in order to clear a path to the portal for Raleigh and Mako. Since <i>Gipsy Danger</i> is powered by a <a href=""/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_core"" title=""Nuclear reactor core"">nuclear reactor core</a>, it can be used as an improvised bomb to destroy The Breach. The resulting explosion destroys <i>Striker Eureka</i> and kills Pentecost and Hansen, Raiju, but only injures Slattern.</p>', u""<p>The battle with Raiju and Scunner leaves <i>Gipsy Danger</i> crippled. A heavily damaged Gipsy approaches the portal but is attacked by a weakened, though not dead Slattern. Gipsy tackles Slattern, killing it with her sword and chest turbine, then passes through the portal latched onto its corpse. The Gipsy Danger crew are losing oxygen rapidly, so Raleigh gives Mako his share, and deploys her ejection pod. He then proceeds to manually overload the nuclear reactor just as Gipsy enters the Anteverse. Raleigh ejects himself out and back to Earth seconds before Gipsy Danger is set to self-destruct and detonates, on the other side of the portal, decimating the alien forces, their base and sealing off the Breach. Raleigh is able to jettison his escape pod and return to Earth before the portal collapses. Mako and Raleigh's escape pods surface safely in the Pacific.</p>"", u'<p>The two pods reach the surface, but Raleigh\'s is not responding with a pulse, and they fear that he is dead. Mako swims to Raleigh\'s pod, opening it, and hugging him in relief. He jokes that he couldn\'t breathe because she was holding him and embracing too tightly. Tendo tells them that rescue helicopters are on their way to get them, and that they\'ve done well. Herc then addressed the Shatterdome as ""Marshal,"" telling them to stop the war clock that counted down how much more time until the next attack, and the PPDC breaks out in cheers.</p>', u'<p>After initial credits roll, a mid credits sequence shows Hannibal Chau slicing himself out of the belly of the infant kaiju that swallowed him whole, demanding his missing shoe.

The group is aided by treasonous members of the prime minister\'s own detail, including Dave Forbes (<a href=""/wiki/Dylan_McDermott"" title=""Dylan McDermott"">Dylan McDermott</a>), a former Secret Service agent. Asher and several top officials are held hostage in the <a href=""/wiki/Presidential_Emergency_Operations_Center"" title=""Presidential Emergency Operations Center"">White House bunker</a>; Prime Minister Lee is executed on live video. Before his own death, detail agent Roma (<a href=""/wiki/Cole_Hauser"" title=""Cole Hauser"">Cole Hauser</a>) alerts the <a href=""/wiki/Director_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service"" title=""Director of the United States Secret Service"">Director of the Secret Service</a> Lynne Jacobs (<a href=""/wiki/Angela_Bassett"" title=""Angela Bassett"">Angela Bassett</a>) that ""Olympus has fallen"".</p>', u'<p>Kang seeks to use Asher\'s hostage status as leverage to force U.S. officials to withdraw the <a href=""/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet"" title=""United States Seventh Fleet"">Seventh Fleet</a> and <a href=""/wiki/United_States_Forces_Korea"" title=""United States Forces Korea"">U.S. forces</a> from the <a href=""/wiki/Korean_Peninsula"" title=""Korean Peninsula"">Korean Peninsula</a>, removing American opposition to a North Korean invasion of South Korea. He also seeks to destroy the American nuclear weapons stockpile by detonating them in their respective silos across the country, turning the U.S. into an irradiated wasteland as revenge for the deaths of his family. To accomplish this, he requires the access codes to a system in the bunker called Cerberus, which are held by three top government officials within the bunker, including the President. Asher orders the other two officials to reveal their codes to save their lives, certain that he will not give up his code.</p>', u'<p>During the initial assault by Kang\'s forces, Banning joins the White House\'s combatants. He falls back into the White House, disabling the internal surveillance and gaining access to Asher\'s satellite ear phone, which he uses to maintain contact with Jacobs and Allan Trumbull (<a href=""/wiki/Morgan_Freeman"" title=""Morgan Freeman"">Morgan Freeman</a>), the <a href=""/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives"" title=""Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"">Speaker of the House</a>, now the <a href=""/wiki/Acting_President_of_the_United_States"" title=""Acting President of the United States"">Acting President</a>. Authorized to proceed, Banning\u2019s first act is to save Connor, whom Kang plans to use to force Asher to reveal his Cerberus code. Banning finds Connor hiding in the walls, thanks to the training Banning had given him, and sneaks the boy to safety. Banning begins reconnaissance and reduces the terrorists\' numbers. Banning kills Forbes, first convincing the traitor to report to Kang that Banning is dead.

Kang deploys an advanced anti-aircraft gun system in his possession. Discovering the system, Banning advises Trumbull and Clegg to abort the mission, but the new weapon system annihilates the assault force before Banning can stop it. Kang retaliates for the infiltration by killing Vice President Charlie Rodriguez (Phil Austin).</p>', u'<p>After Banning disables Kang\u2019s communications, Kang tries to execute Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan (<a href=""/wiki/Melissa_Leo"" title=""Melissa Leo"">Melissa Leo</a>) outside the White House in front of the media, but Banning rescues her, taking out several of Kang\'s men in the process. With his forces dwindling, Kang fakes both his own death and Asher\'s by sacrificing several of his men and the remaining hostages. However, Banning believes that Kang has faked his death and will attempt to sneak away. Kang eventually cracks Asher\u2019s code using a computer algorithm to focus on Asher\'s over the other codes and activates Cerberus. As Kang attempts to escape, Banning kills the remaining terrorists, but Kang shoots Asher in the abdomen when the President tries to resist. Banning kills Kang by stabbing him in the head with a knife then disables Cerberus with the assistance of Trumbull, with only seconds to spare. During daybreak that day, Banning walks out with Asher and is received by the soldiers posted to await their arrival. After the events, the U.S. begins to heal from the attack, while Banning once again heads the president\'s security detail. President Asher addresses the public while Banning, Jacobs, Clegg, and Connor observe.</p>']"

Instructed by mission controller Sally (<a href=""/wiki/Melissa_Leo"" title=""Melissa Leo"">Melissa Leo</a>) and assisted by drones, they protect the generators from attack by any remaining Scavs. Despite having had a memory wipe, Jack experiences visions of being on the observation deck of the <a href=""/wiki/Empire_State_Building"" title=""Empire State Building"">Empire State Building</a> with an unknown woman before the war.</p>', u'<p>Jack investigates the site where a module from a pre-invasion human spacecraft, the <i>Odyssey</i>, has crashed. He finds several working stasis chambers containing surviving humans in a hibernative state; including one that contains the woman from his visions, Julia (<a href=""/wiki/Olga_Kurylenko"" title=""Olga Kurylenko"">Olga Kurylenko</a>). A drone arrives and begins to destroy the stasis chambers. Jack saves Julia, but the drone kills the remaining survivors. Later, Jack and Julia return to retrieve the flight recorder and are captured by Scavs. The Scavs turn out to be human survivors, not aliens. Their leader Malcolm Beech (<a href=""/wiki/Morgan_Freeman"" title=""Morgan Freeman"">Morgan Freeman</a>) wants Jack\'s help to destroy the Tet by reprogramming a captured drone that contains ten stolen fuel cells attached to a nuclear device. He tries to convince Jack that everything he knows is a lie, but Jack does not believe him; Beech releases them, saying the truth can be found in one of the forbidden radiation zones.</p>', u'<p>En route back to Tower 49, Jack and Julia go to the Empire State Building where Julia tells Jack that she is his wife. Their team, which included Vika, was heading towards Titan when they encountered the Tet, an alien ship, and was diverted to investigate it. Since she was in stasis, she doesn\'t know what happened after they left. They fly back to Tower 49 but Vika, monitoring their movements, refuses entry and reports to Sally that she and Jack are not ""an effective team"". Sally activates a disabled drone hidden inside the tower that kills Vika but is destroyed by Julia. Jack and Julia escape with the other drones in pursuit. Jack\'s ship is damaged and they jettison in the forbidden zone, which lacks the warned-of radioactivity. They encounter Tech 52 Jack, an exact clone of Jack, and during a scuffle Julia is shot. Seeing Julia, Tech 52 Jack falters and experiences the same visions Tech 49 Jack experienced. After incapacitating and tying up Jack 52, Tech 49 Jack flies to Tower 52, finding a Vika clone there. He obtains medical supplies and returns to treat the wounded Julia.</p>', u'<p>After an evening at the lake-house Jack built, the two return to the Scavs. Beech reveals that the Tet is the hostile alien force, mining the Earth\'s resources while eliminating humanity. In 2017, the Tet arrived in orbit and destroyed the Moon, to devastate and disorient the human population. Massive earthquakes and tsunamis than destroyed most major cities, and millions more starved to death in the chaos. Soon afterwards the Tet landed waves of troopships, containing thousands of Jack clones programmed purely to kill. After the surviving humans were reduced to only a handful, about 50 years ago the Tet moved on to its second phase, using massive water pump machines to suck Earth\'s oceans dry for fuel, guarded by patrol drones which were serviced and maintained by a new generation of Jack and Victoria clones. ""Sally"" is just a computer generated image that the Tet uses to communicate with these ground crews, based on the head of the original <i>Odyssey</i> mission\'s ground crew.</p>', u""<p>Tracking Jack's biometric readings, the Tet sends drones to breach the complex, which Jack helps the others defend. Beech is gravely injured and the captured drone is damaged beyond repair. The humans try to regroup but fear an imminent attack. At Julia's suggestion, Jack communicates with the Tet via Sally, agreeing to turn over Julia to her. The Tet wants Julia because it believes that, as Jack's wife, a new set of clones based on her will make a more effective team than the Jack and Vika clones. After saying goodbye and placing Julia in a stasis chamber, Jack flies to the Tet while listening to the <i>Odyssey</i>\u200d\u200a'\u200bs flight recorder and learning the fate of its commander, astronaut Jack Harper: he, Vika and Julia were crew members aboard the <i>Odyssey</i>, which was originally an exploration mission to Titan. The mission was re-routed by the real Sally at mission control to investigate the Tet, then near Saturn's orbit and therefore close to the original trajectory. Originally appearing inactive, the Tet began to pull the spacecraft towards it. Sensing danger, Jack jettisoned the sleep module, an emergency escape pod programmed to orbit Earth, to save the crew members in stasis. Jack and Vika were then captured by the Tet.</p>"", u""<p>While entering the Tet, escorted by two drones, Jack glides past thousands of pods containing Jack and Vika clones. Upon final interrogation, he tells a doubting Sally he believes this is the only way Julia will survive and is granted access into the Tet's main control center. Now deep inside the Tet, Jack unloads and opens the sleep chamber which surprisingly contains Beech and a fuel cell bomb. They trigger the bomb, destroying the Tet and shutting down the attacking drones before they reach the human base, with Tech 49 Jack and Beech being killed in the process. On Earth, Julia awakens from the stasis chamber at the lake-house in time to see the Tet destroyed. Three years later, Julia and her young daughter are living in the lake-house.

At the command center, Finnerty uses Emily\'s video to discover the identities of the mercenaries, who used to work for various government agencies. They also discover that Walker has an inoperable tumor, suggesting his involvement to be a suicide mission and that the attack is meant for more dangerous reasons. Cale and Sawyer find the tunnel gate rigged with an explosive and are forced to escape with a presidential limo. After giving chase with Stenz on the White House lawn, Cale and Sawyer get flipped into the White House pool after Cale gets distracted by Killick holding Emily at gunpoint.

Sawyer attacks a distracted Walker, who ultimately gains the upper hand and uses him to activate the football before supposedly shooting him chest dead, infuriating Emily. Using updated launch codes received by an anonymous source, Walker begins targeting various cities in Iran, but before he initiates the launch, Cale crashes into the office and kills Walker with a minigun. When Emily is told of the air strike, she takes a presidential flag and waves it on the front lawn to get the fighters to call off the attack, which is what they eventually do.

Driving dangerously fast on a snowy road, Jeffrey loses control and the car slides off and down the mountain, crashing into the woods. Surviving, he takes the children into an abandoned cabin and builds a fire, even though Victoria is resistant, thinking she saw someone inside. Planning to kill his daughters and commit suicide, he holds a gun to Victoria\'s head, but a shadowy figure suddenly drags him away, suspending him in the air and strangling him with his tie. Victoria turns around, but because her father had taken her glasses away, she did not see the gun and could not see what was happening. The girls, huddled by the fireside, are tossed a cherry by the mysterious figure.</p>', u'<p>Five years later, a rescue party, sponsored by Jeffrey\'s <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Identical_twin"" title=""Identical twin"">identical twin</a> brother Lucas, finds Victoria and Lilly alive, but in a <a href=""/wiki/Feral_child"" title=""Feral child"">feral state</a> after years of isolation. The girls are put in a welfare clinic under the psychiatric care of Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss. They make reference to ""Mama"", a maternal protector figure. When Lucas tries to communicate with the girls, they are initially hostile, but Victoria recognizes him after he gives her a pair of glasses and she can see him properly. Dreyfuss agrees to support Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel\'s custody claim against the girls\' maternal great-aunt, Jean Podolski. In exchange, they must move into a clinic-owned house and grant Dreyfuss continued contact with Victoria and Lilly for research purposes. When Victoria and Lilly arrive at the house, Victoria acclimates quickly to domestic life at the house while Lilly initially retains much of her feralness, not being used to being around people like Lucas or Annabel.</p>', u'<p>While in bed with Lucas, Annabel is startled by the appearance of a shadowy, monstrous figure in their doorway. While investigating, Lucas is attacked by ""Mama"" and is put into a coma after falling down the stairs. Annabel, who has no relation to the girls and is uncomfortable being around them, finds herself left alone to care for them. Although Annabel makes progress with Victoria, she finds Lilly hostile. Alarmed by nightmares of a woman and Victoria\'s warning about Mama\'s jealousy, Annabel asks Dreyfuss to investigate. He initially thought ""Mama"" to be an imaginary <a href=""/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder"" title=""Dissociative identity disorder"">alter-ego</a> of Victoria, believing she had to take on a parental role to take care of Lilly for five years; however, his research corroborates Victoria\'s story that Mama is an aggrieved mother and brings to light the story of Edith Brennan, a <a href=""/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"" title=""Psychiatric hospital"">mental asylum</a> patient in the 1800s.</p>', u'<p>Dreyfuss recovers a box from a government warehouse containing a baby\'s remains, and first encounters Mama when interviewing Victoria again. Annabel has a nightmare revealing Mama\'s past: when Edith Brennan (""Mama"") was sent to St. Gertrude\'s Asylum, her child was taken from her and given to nuns. She escaped the asylum, stabbed a nun and took her baby back. Fleeing her pursuers, Brennan jumped off a cliff, but before hitting the water below, Brennan and the child made impact with a large branch (accounting for her misshapen head) and her unconscious body fell into the water and she drowned; Edith\'s child died on impact with the branch, but the baby\'s blanket-wrapped corpse snagged on the branch and did not fall with Brennan into the water below. Annabel realizes that Mama still doesn\'t realize her child died from hitting the tree; Mama unsuccessfully searched the woods for more than a century and had taken on Victoria and Lilly as substitutes.</p>', u""<p>Lucas regains consciousness after a disturbing vision of his dead brother, Jeffrey, tells him to go to the cabin in the woods and save his daughters. Annabel and the girls are visited by Jean, who is alarmed by the girls' bruises from their still-animalistic behavior, and tries to get Annabel investigated for child abuse. Victoria's growing closeness to Annabel makes her less willing to play with Mama, unlike Lilly.</p>"", u""<p>Dreyfuss visits the cabin at night to investigate and attempts to communicate with Mama. After his flashlight stops working, he uses the flash of his camera as a light but is suddenly attacked and killed by Mama. Finding Dreyfuss missing, Annabel steals the girls' case files from his office. She learns that Brennan and Mama are the same person, while Lucas leaves the hospital to search for the cabin. Shortly after making a breakthrough with Lilly after finding her outside in the cold, Annabel and the girls are attacked by a jealous Mama, who kills Jean and uses her body to spirit the children away in Jean's automobile. Annabel regains consciousness and hurries off to save the children. She meets Lucas along the way, and he joins her to find the children.</p>"", u""<p>The couple spot the children on the same cliff where Brennan leaped with her child to their deaths over a century earlier. Mama is preparing to re-enact her fall, taking Victoria and Lilly with her. When Annabel offers Mama the remains of her child, Mama takes the skeleton, and transforms into her human form, sobbing at the baby's death. However, when Lilly (who, being younger than her sister, remembers only Mama as her original parent) calls out for her, Mama reverts to her more monstrous form, throws the baby's remains off the cliff, and takes the girls again, nearly killing Annabel and Lucas (but refraining from doing so mainly because Victoria clearly shows she cares about them). Lucas is knocked unconscious, but Annabel clings to Victoria, who asks to stay with Annabel instead of leaving with Mama after Annabel's struggle for Victoria to stay, despite Lilly's pleas to come with her. After a tearful farewell, Mama and Lilly float off the cliff and fall, turning into a shower of moths when they hit the branch that originally killed Brennan and her baby. The film ends with Annabel and Lucas embracing Victoria, and Victoria noticing a moth with bright blue wings (as opposed to Mama's moths, which were all dark) landing on her hand, indicating that Lilly is still with her in some form.</p>""]"

2012,US,Dr. Seuss' The Lorax,boxofficemojo,United States,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lorax_(film),"[u'<p>Ted Wiggins is an idealistic 12-year-old boy, who lives in ""Thneedville"", a walled city that, aside from the human citizens, is completely artificial; everything is made of plastic, metal, or synthetics with no living plants. Ted has a crush on local environmentalist Audrey, who wants to see a ""real tree"" more than anything in the world, and decides to find one in order to impress her. His energetic Grammy Norma secretly tells Ted the legend of the Once-ler, who will tell anyone about trees if you brought him fifteen cents, a nail, and a shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail. When Ted leaves Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, he discovers that the outside world is a contaminated, empty wasteland. Once the boy finds him, the Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees on the condition that he listens to the story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, but on his way home, he encounters the mayor of Thneedville, Aloysius O\'Hare, who is also the proprietor of a company that sells bottled oxygen to Thneedville residents. O\'Hare explains to Ted that because trees produce oxygen free of charge, he considers it a threat to his business whenever he hears people talking about them. After revealing that he has ""security camera eyes"" all over the city, O\'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town. However, Ted continues to sneak out of O\'Hare\'s sight (with his grandmother\'s encouragement) and learns more of the trees\' history.</p>', u'<p>Over Ted\'s various visits, the Once-ler recounts the story of how he departed his family to make his fortune. After stumbling upon a lush Truffula Tree forest, the Once-ler meets the guardian of the forest, the Lorax, after cutting down a Truffula Tree. The Lorax urges Once-ler to leave the forest, but Once-ler refuses. Eventually, the Once-ler promises not to chop another tree down, and the two seem to begin a friendship of sorts. Then, the young businessman\'s Thneed invention becomes a major success and Once-ler\'s family arrives to participate in the business. At first keeping his promise, the Once-ler continues Thneed production by harvesting the Truffula Tree tufts in a slow, but sustainable manner. However, soon his greedy and lazy relatives convince him to resume chopping down the trees. Over time, the Once-ler\'s deforestation spirals into a mass overproduction. Flushed with wealth, the Once-ler rationalizes his short-sighted needs into arrogant self-righteousness, and the Lorax\'s helpless protests do not stop him. The Once-ler pollutes the sky, river, and landscape, until the very last Truffula Tree falls. With no further chance of business, he is left broken and abandoned by his family, with his mother disowning him, and with the region uninhabitable because of his business\'s pollution, the Lorax sends the animals off to find a new place to live before he departs into the sky, leaving only a stone-cut word: ""Unless"". Distraught and ruined, the Once-ler became a recluse.</p>', u""<p>After he finishes telling his story, the Once-ler finally understands the meaning behind the Lorax's last message, and gives Ted the last Truffula seed in hopes that he can plant it and make others care about real trees once more. Ted's desire to impress Audrey is now a personal mission to remind his town of the importance of nature. O'Hare, still determined not to have trees undermine his business, takes heavy-handed steps such as covering Audrey's nature paintings, closing off the door that Ted uses to see the Once-ler, and forcibly searching Ted's room for the seed. Ted enlists his family and Audrey to help plant the seed, which has begun to germinate after coming into contact with water. O'Hare and his employees pursue the dissidents until they manage to elude him and reach the town center. When Ted finally attempts to plant the seed, he is interrupted by O'Hare, who rallies the population to stop them by telling the people that trees are dangerous and filthy. To convince them otherwise, Ted takes an earthmover and rams down a section of the city wall to reveal the environmental destruction outside, thereby showing them what O'Hare is encouraging. Horrified at the sight and inspired by Ted's conviction, the crowd defies O'Hare, with his own henchmen expelling him from the town. The seed is finally planted, and Audrey kisses Ted on the cheek. Time passes and the land starts to recover; new trees sprout, the animals begin to return, and the redeemed Once-ler is happily reunited with the Lorax.</p>""]"

The <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Radical_Republicans"" title=""Radical Republicans"">Radical Republicans</a> fear the amendment will be defeated by some who merely wish to delay its passage; the support of the amendment by Republicans in the border states is not yet assured either, since they prioritize the issue of ending the war. Even if all of them are ultimately brought on board, the amendment will still require the support of several <a href=""/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"" title=""Democratic Party (United States)"">Democratic</a> congressmen if it is to pass.

Lincoln, however, remains adamant about having the amendment in place and the issue of slavery settled before the war is concluded and the southern states readmitted into the Union.</p>', u'<p>Lincoln\'s hopes for passage of the amendment rely upon the support of <a href=""/wiki/Francis_Preston_Blair"" title=""Francis Preston Blair"">Francis Preston Blair</a>, a founder of the Republican Party whose influence can ensure that all members of the western and border state conservative Republican faction will back the amendment. With Union victory in the Civil War seeming highly likely and greatly anticipated, but not yet a fully accomplished fact, and with two sons serving in the Union Army, Blair is keen to end the hostilities as soon as possible. Therefore, in return for his support, Blair insists that Lincoln allow him to immediately engage the <a href=""/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"" title=""Confederate States of America"">Confederate</a> government in peace negotiations. This is a complication to Lincoln\'s amendment efforts since he knows that a significant portion of the support he has garnered for the amendment is from the Radical Republican faction for whom a negotiated peace that leaves slavery intact is morally unacceptable.

Since those members also will soon be in need of employment and Lincoln will have many federal jobs to fill as he begins his second term, he sees this as a tool he can use to his advantage. Though Lincoln and Seward are unwilling to offer direct monetary <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Bribe"" title=""Bribe"">bribes</a> to the Democrats, they authorize agents to quietly go about contacting Democratic congressmen with offers of federal jobs in exchange for their voting in favor of the amendment.</p>', u'<p>With Confederate envoys ready to meet with Lincoln, he instructs them to be kept out of <a href=""/wiki/Washington,_D.C."" title=""Washington, D.C."">Washington</a>, as the amendment approaches a vote on the House floor.

Pat soon learns that his estranged wife, Nikki, has moved away, and that his father is out of work and resorting to <a href=""/wiki/Bookmaker#Legality"" title=""Bookmaker"">illegal bookmaking</a> to earn money with the hopes of opening a restaurant. Pat is determined to get his life back on track and reconcile with Nikki, who obtained a restraining order against him after a violent episode sent him away.</p>', u'<p>While talking to his court-mandated therapist Dr. Cliff Patel (<a href=""/wiki/Anupam_Kher"" title=""Anupam Kher"">Kher</a>), Pat explains why he was hospitalized: Coming home early from his high school teaching job after getting into an argument with the school\'s principal, he had found his wife in the shower with the history teacher from his school while his wedding song is playing, and nearly beat the man to death. Pat recognizes that hearing the song, My Cherie Amour, can trigger a violent episode, and that sometimes when he is distressed, he hears the song though it is not playing. Despite this, Pat doesn\'t believe that he needs medication to manage his condition. He tells Cliff that he has a new outlook on life. This is a reference to the name of the film, as he attempts to see the good, or ""<a href=""/wiki/Silver_lining_(idiom)"" title=""Silver lining (idiom)"">silver linings</a>"", in all that he experiences. As part of this outlook, and his transformation to become a more worthy husband, he has lost weight and is attempting to read the books that his wife Nikki teaches to children at her school.</p>', u""<p>At dinner with his friend Ronnie and his wife Veronica, Pat meets Veronica's sister Tiffany, a young widow who lost her job and is suffering from depression. Her dark past and blunt way of speaking make others uncomfortable, but she and Pat develop an odd friendship through their shared mental illnesses. They get together to eat at a diner and after an argument in the street which Tiffany escalates claiming Pat's assaulting her, she then comes to his defense when the police show up and he becomes distressed, hearing his wedding song. Tiffany eventually offers to deliver a letter to Nikki if, in return, he will be her partner in an upcoming dance competition. He reluctantly agrees and the two begin a rigorous practice regimen over the following weeks. Pat believes the competition will be a good way to show Nikki that he has changed and become a better person.</p>"", u'<p>Things go well for Pat until his father asks him to attend a <a href=""/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles"" title=""Philadelphia Eagles"">Philadelphia Eagles</a> game as a ""good-luck charm"", partly because he has bet virtually all of his money on the outcome. Pat asks Tiffany for time off from practice to attend the game, which she begrudgingly allows. Tiffany also gives Pat a typed reply from Nikki, in which she cautiously hints there may be a chance for a reconciliation between them. While at the game with his friends, Pat does well and is having fun at a tailgate, until some racist fans harass the Indian fans there, including Dr. Patel. Pat gets involved in a fight after seeing his brother get punched, and he is hauled away by the police. The Eagles lose the game and Patrizio is furious. Tiffany shows up at their house and berates Patrizio, pointing out that the way she is ""reading the signs,"" Philadelphia teams do better when she and Pat are together, as they won every game they played when Tiffany and Pat were spending time together. Patrizio, now convinced that his son being with Tiffany is actually good luck, makes a <a href=""/wiki/Parlay_(gambling)"" title=""Parlay (gambling)"">parlay</a> with his gambling friend that if the Eagles win their game against the <a href=""/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys"" title=""Dallas Cowboys"">Dallas Cowboys</a>, <i>and</i> if Tiffany and Pat average a score of 5 out of 10 in their dance competition, he will win back double the money he lost on the first bet. Pat is reluctant to participate in the dance contest under those conditions, goes outside to consult Nikki\'s letter, and notices that it also refers to ""reading the signs,"" realizing that Tiffany wrote the letter. With the Solatanos\' finances in danger, Tiffany and Pat\'s mother persuade Pat to dance in the competition by telling him that Nikki will be there.</p>', u'<p>Tiffany, Pat, and their friends and family arrive at the competition on the night of the football game. Tiffany despairs when she finds that Nikki actually is in the audience, so Tiffany goes to the hotel bar and starts drinking with a stranger. Moments before their dance, Pat finds her and practically drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the Cowboys.</p>', u""<p>At the conclusion of their set, cute but obviously unprofessional, Tiffany and Pat score exactly 5 points. Amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd, Pat approaches Nikki and speaks quietly into her ear. Tiffany sees this and runs from the hotel. Pat leaves Nikki behind after a short conversation, intent on finding Tiffany. Pat's father informs him that Tiffany left and tells him that he loves her right now and that it will be a sin if he does not reach out to this moment that life has given him. Pat tells his father that he loves him, and runs after Tiffany. He hands Tiffany a letter that he wrote to her, in which he admits that he knows she forged Nikki's letter. He confesses his love for her and that he loved her from the moment he met her, and apologizes that it took him so long to come to terms with this. They share a kiss, become a couple, and Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won. The final moments in the movie between Pat and Tiffany show that both of them are no longer wearing their wedding rings.</p>""]"

Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to <i>Prometheus</i>, but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure, while the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside.

Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland has been in stasis aboard <i>Prometheus</i>.

He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in an attempt to explain what Weyland wants.

The release of the film <i><a href=""/wiki/House_of_Dark_Shadows"" title=""House of Dark Shadows"">House of Dark Shadows</a></i> in September of that year is also thought to have caused TV ratings to fall, perhaps because of parents who attended the film with their children and, seeing the amount of blood spilled across the screen, discouraged their children\'s choice of television viewing material.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Beginning in the fall of 1970, several ABC stations across the country dropped the show due to falling viewership.

Thus, the network began weeding out supposedly unproductive programming. Despite its relatively high station clearances for its timeslot and low production costs, <i>Dark Shadows</i> fell victim to the purge mainly because of its young audience, who usually did not make decisions about the purchasing of household goods and food products for the family, which were the two chief industries that bought airtime on daytime television in that era. Practically no other daytime show skewed so much under the 18\u201335 demographic threshold as <i>Dark Shadows</i> did.

In addition and probably more decisively, the program experienced a precipitous drop in its ratings during its last two years on the air, falling from a peak of 8.4 in the 1968\u20131969 television season to a 5.3 in 1970\u20131971.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-11""><a href=""#cite_note-11""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Reflecting on the series\' cancellation, in an interview included in a 2005 DVD release, series creator <a href=""/wiki/Dan_Curtis"" title=""Dan Curtis"">Dan Curtis</a> welcomed the show\'s cancellation, feeling it had run out of fresh ideas: ""I was just hoping it was going to end.

After some persuasion from Chloe Beale (<a href=""/wiki/Brittany_Snow"" title=""Brittany Snow"">Brittany Snow</a>) the co-leader of the Bellas along with Aubrey, she reluctantly joins the Barden Bellas.

A short scuffle after the competition leads to Beca accidentally smashing a window with the trophy which alerts a police officer standing outside who then arrests her. Jesse tries to help by calling Beca's father, who then tells Beca that he will no longer pay for her to move to Los Angeles because of the incident.

The Bellas re-form after spring break, with the notable exception of Beca. During rehearsals, Chloe stands up against Aubrey\'s stubbornness. The group starts to fall apart, which sparks a fight. Meanwhile, Beca tries to apologize to Jesse, which he declines. Beca then apologizes to the Bellas for her actions during the semi-finals and asks to have another chance, which Aubrey eventually allows.

2011,US,The Help,boxofficemojo,United States,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Help,"[u'<p><i>The Help</i> is set in the early 1960s in <a href=""/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi"" title=""Jackson, Mississippi"">Jackson, Mississippi</a>, and told primarily from the first-person perspectives of three women: Aibileen, Minny, and Skeeter. Aibileen is a maid who takes care of children and cleans. Her first job since her own 24-year-old son, Treelore, died from an accident on his job, is tending the Leefolt household and caring for their toddler, Mae Mobley. Minny is Aibileen\'s friend who frequently tells her employers what she thinks of them, resulting in her having been fired from nineteen jobs. Minny\'s most recent employer was Mrs. Walters, mother of Hilly Holbrook.</p>', u'<p>Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan is the daughter of a white family whose cotton farm employs many African Americans in the fields, as well as in the household. Skeeter has just returned home after finishing college and wants to become a writer. Skeeter\'s mother wants her to get married, and thinks her degree is just a pretty piece of paper. Skeeter is curious about the disappearance of Constantine, her maid. Constantine had written to Skeeter while she was away from home in college saying what a great surprise she had when she came home. Skeeter\'s mother tells her that Constantine quit and went to live with relatives in <a href=""/wiki/Chicago"" title=""Chicago"">Chicago</a>. Skeeter does not believe that Constantine would leave her like this; she knows something is wrong and believes that information will eventually come forth. Everyone Skeeter asks about the strange disappearance of Constantine pretends it never happened and avoids giving her any real answers.</p>', u""<p>The life that Constantine led while being the help to the Phelan family leads Skeeter to the realization that her friends' maids are treated very differently from the way the white employees are treated. She decides (with the assistance of a publisher) that she wants to reveal the truth about being a colored maid in Mississippi. Skeeter struggles to communicate with the maids and gain their trust. The dangers of undertaking writing a book about African Americans speaking out in the South during the early 1960s hover constantly over the three women.</p>"", u'<p>The story opens when Skeeter returns from four years at college; when Aibileen begins working for Mrs Elizabeth Leefolt; and when Minny is let go from her job working for Mrs. Walters and begins working for Celia Foote. When Skeeter rejoins her friends at their weekly bridge club meeting at Elizabeth\u2019s house, Hilly Holbrook asks Skeeter to place an advertisement in the <a href=""/wiki/Junior_League"" title=""Junior League"">Junior League</a>\u2019s newsletter about the benefits of installing a separate bathroom for the \u201ccolored help.\u201d Skeeter is offended by the suggestion that domestic workers of color need a separate toilet, but does not confront her friend about this. Instead she simply does not place the ad in the paper. Before Skeeter leaves the brunch/card game, she asks Aibileen if she would like to see \u201cthings change?\u201d Aibileen does not know what Skeeter means, and is suspicious of the young woman\u2019s motives for making such a statement.</p>', u'<p>Eventually Skeeter wins Aibileen\u2019s trust through a friendship that develops while Aibileen helps Skeeter write a household tips column for the local newspaper. Skeeter accepted the job to write the column as a stepping stone to becoming a writer/editor, as was suggested by Elaine Stein, editor at <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Harper_%26_Row"" title=""Harper &amp; Row"">Harper &amp; Row</a>, even though she knows nothing about cleaning or taking care of a household, since that is the exclusive domain of \u2018the help.\u2019 The irony of this fact is not lost on Skeeter, and she eventually offers to pay Aibileen for the time and expertise she received from her.</p>', u'<p>Elaine Stein had also suggested to Skeeter that she find a subject to write about which she can be dedicated to and passionate about. Skeeter realizes that she wants to expose to the world in the form of a book the deplorable conditions the maids in the South endure in order to barely survive. Unfortunately such an expos\xe9 is a dangerous proposition, not just for Skeeter, but for any maids that agree to help her. Aibileen finally agrees to tell her story, but she cannot persuade any of her friends to join in the project.</p>', u""<p>Yule May, Hilly's maid is arrested and sentence to jail for four years for stealing a ring, which she stole from Hilly to pay her twin sons\u2019 college tuition after Hilly refused to lend the money. The other maids decide that they are willing to take a chance with their jobs, and their safety, and join the book project that Aibileen and Skeeter are working on.</p>"", u'<p>Thus the thrust of the book is the collaborative project between the white, privileged Skeeter and the struggling, exploited \u201ccolored\u201d help, who together are writing a book of true stories about their experiences as the \u2018help\u2019 to the white women of Jackson, Mississippi. Not all the stories are negative, and some describe beautiful and generous, loving and kind events; while others are cruel and even brutal. The book, entitled \u201cThe Help\u201d is finally published, and the final chapters of \u201cThe Help\u201d describe the aftermath of the books\u2019 appearance in Jackson.</p>']"

Nala urges Simba to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a wasteland with not enough food and water. Feeling guilty over his father\'s death, Simba refuses and storms off, leaving Nala disappointed and angry. As Simba exits the jungle, he encounters Mufasa\'s <a href=""/wiki/Mandrill"" title=""Mandrill"">mandrill</a> friend and advisor, Rafiki. Rafiki tells Simba that Mufasa is ""alive"" and takes him to a pond. There Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as the king of the Pride Lands. Simba realizes he can no longer run from his past and goes home. Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa join him, and agree to help him fight.</p>', u'<p>At the Pride Lands, Simba sees Scar hit Sarabi and confronts him, but Scar taunts Simba over his ""part"" in Mufasa\'s death. However, when Scar pushes Simba to the edge of Pride Rock, he reveals that he himself killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba roars back up and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs Simba for mercy, saying he is family and placing the blame on the hyenas. Simba says he does not believe Scar anymore but spares his life and commands him to forever leave the Pride Lands. Scar meekly walks past him, but then attacks his nephew. After a fierce fight, Simba throws his uncle off Pride Rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his plot to betray them.</p>', u'<p>With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba ascends to the top of Pride Rock and takes over the kingdom as the rain falls again. Sometime later, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Simba looks down happily at his kingdom with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa by his side; Rafiki presents Simba and Nala\'s newborn cub to the inhabitants of the Pride Lands, and the ""circle of life"" continues.</p>']"

Muppets are typically made of softer materials. They are also presented as being independent of the puppeteer, who is usually not visible\u2014hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. Using the camera frame as the ""stage"" was an innovation of the Muppets. Previously on television, there would typically be a stage hiding the performers, as if in a live presentation. Sometimes they are seen full-bodied. This is done by using invisible strings to move the characters\' bodies and mouths, and then adding the voices later.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>', u'<p>Muppets tend to develop, as writer Michael Davis put it, ""organically"", meaning that the puppeteers take time, often up to a year, slowly developing their characters and voices.

One consequence of this design is that most Muppets are left-handed as the puppeteer uses his right hand to operate the head while operating the arm rod with his left hand. There are many other common designs and means of operation. In advanced Muppets, several puppeteers may control a single character; the performer who controls the mouth usually provides the voice for the character. As technology has evolved, the Jim Henson team and other puppeteers have developed an enormous variety of means to operate Muppets for film and television, including the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, remote radio control, and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of a mix of technologies has allowed for scenes in which Muppets appear to be riding a bicycle, rowing a boat, and even dancing on-stage with no puppeteer in sight.</p>']"

He and the girls, and also Alex\'s <a href=""/wiki/Slacker"" title=""Slacker"">slacker</a> boyfriend Sid (<a href=""/wiki/Nick_Krause"" title=""Nick Krause"">Nick Krause</a>), travel to Kauai to find Brian. While there, Matt\'s cousin, Hugh (<a href=""/wiki/Beau_Bridges"" title=""Beau Bridges"">Beau Bridges</a>) mentions that Brian is brother-in-law to Don Hollitzer, the developer the family wants to sell the land to. Brian stands to make a small fortune from the sales commission.</p>', u'<p>Matt confronts Brian and informs him Elizabeth is dying and offers him an opportunity to see her one last time. Brian declines, admitting that although Elizabeth was in love with him, it was only a fling to him; he loves his wife, Julie (<a href=""/wiki/Judy_Greer"" title=""Judy Greer"">Judy Greer</a>) and their children, then apologizes to Matt for the pain he caused.</p>', u'<p>When Elizabeth is disconnected from life support, her father, Scott (<a href=""/wiki/Robert_Forster"" title=""Robert Forster"">Robert Forster</a>) admonishes Matt for not being a more generous and loving husband. Choosing not to disclose the details of her affair to Scott, Matt agrees, but Sid and Alex both unexpectedly defend Matt.</p>', u'<p>At the King family meeting, Matt overrules the majority of his cousins who favor selling to Hollitzer. Matt decides to keep the land and look for a different solution to the problem posed by the Rule Against Perpetuities. Shocked, Hugh tells Matt that he and the other cousins will take legal action if Matt refuses to sell, but Matt is undeterred.</p>', u'<p>Julie, after learning of Brian\'s affair with Elizabeth and realizing that he will not visit, comes to the hospital, partly feeling that decency obliges her to. She tearfully admits to Elizabeth that she wants to hate her for ""trying to destroy"" her family, but that she forgives her.</p>', u'<p>Matt finally comes to terms with his wife\'s betrayal and her impending death. He tenderly kisses her goodbye, followed by Alex and Scottie, and later, scatter Elizabeth\'s ashes in the ocean off <a href=""/wiki/Waikiki"" title=""Waikiki"">Waikiki</a>.

Albert\'s best friend, Andrew Easton (<a href=""/wiki/Matt_Milne"" title=""Matt Milne"">Matt Milne</a>), watches as Albert teaches his colt many things, such as to come when he imitates the call of an owl by blowing through his cupped hands.</p>', u'<p>Ted carries a war injury that causes him ongoing physical and mental pain. While he cannot speak of his time in the Cavalry, Rose shows Albert his father\'s medals from the <a href=""/wiki/Second_Boer_War"" title=""Second Boer War"">Second Boer War</a> that he earned for bravery under fire.

German soldiers arrive and confiscate supplies from the property, even the jam that Emilie\'s grandfather makes, but Emilie hides the horses in her bedroom. Emilie suffers from a disease that makes her bones fragile and is not allowed to ride the horses for fear of falling. Nonetheless, Emilie\'s Grandfather, for her birthday, allows her to ride Joey. She gallops the horse up the hill and runs into the Germans who then take the horses, breaking Emilie\'s heart. The grandfather keeps the pennant.</p>', u'<p>The horses are put to work pulling German heavy artillery under the care of Private Friedrich (<a href=""/wiki/Nicolas_Bro"" title=""Nicolas Bro"">Nicolas Bro</a>), who helps them survive this brutal work.</p>', u'<p>By 1918, Albert has enlisted and is fighting alongside Andrew in the <a href=""/wiki/Second_Battle_of_the_Somme_(1918)"" title=""Second Battle of the Somme (1918)"">Second Battle of the Somme</a>, under the command of Lyons\'s son David (<a href=""/wiki/Robert_Emms"" title=""Robert Emms"">Robert Emms</a>).

No other bid is placed, and the grandfather takes ownership of Joey, planning to return with him to his farm. He tells Albert that Emilie has died, and after hearing about the miracle horse, he travelled for three days to get Joey back, for the sake of his beloved granddaughter's memory.</p>"", u""<p>Albert pleads for the horse with Emilie's grandfather, who at first remains stoic. The old man is surprised, however, when the horse chooses to return to Albert, and he presents Albert with the military pennant, asking him what it is.

His girlfriend Lindy (<a href=""/wiki/Abbie_Cornish"" title=""Abbie Cornish"">Abbie Cornish</a>), frustrated with his lack of progress and financial dependence, breaks up with him. Later, Eddie happens to run into Vernon (<a href=""/wiki/Johnny_Whitworth"" title=""Johnny Whitworth"">Johnny Whitworth</a>), the estranged brother of Eddie\'s ex-wife, Melissa (<a href=""/wiki/Anna_Friel"" title=""Anna Friel"">Anna Friel</a>). Vernon, involved with a pharmaceutical company, gives Eddie a sample of a new ""smart drug"", NZT-48. After taking the pill, Eddie finds himself able to learn and analyze at a superhuman rate and recall memories from his distant past, with the only apparent side effect being a change in the color of Eddie\'s irises while on the drug\u2014his eyes becoming an intense shade of electric blue. Under the influence, he cleans his messy apartment and writes ninety pages of his book. The next day, the effects having worn off, he seeks out Vernon in an attempt to get more. While Eddie is out running an errand, Vernon is murdered. Eddie returns, calls the police and then discovers Vernon\'s NZT stash just before they arrive, taking it for himself. After giving a statement at the precinct, Eddie returns home and begins ingesting the drug daily. With the help of the drug\'s amazing effects, Eddie spends a few weeks cleaning up his life\u2014finishing his book, getting fit, and making friends with a group of young <a href=""/wiki/Jet_set"" title=""Jet set"">jet-setters</a>, who take him on vacation to Europe, where he mingles with the rich. During all this, Eddie tests out his enhanced learning abilities; he becomes a proficient piano player in just three days, as well as becoming fluent in several languages.</p>', u'<p>Testing his analytical skills on the stock market, Eddie quickly makes large returns on small investments. Realizing he requires more capital, he borrows one hundred thousand dollars from a Russian loan shark, Gennady (<a href=""/wiki/Andrew_Howard"" title=""Andrew Howard"">Andrew Howard</a>), and successfully makes a return of two million dollars. He increases his NZT dosage and begins to rekindle his relationship with Lindy.</p>', u'<p>Eddie\'s prodigious success leads to a meeting with a finance tycoon, Carl Van Loon (<a href=""/wiki/Robert_De_Niro"" title=""Robert De Niro"">Robert De Niro</a>), who as a test asks Eddie to advise him on a merger with Hank Atwood\'s (<a href=""/wiki/Richard_Bekins"" title=""Richard Bekins"">Richard Bekins</a>) company. Walking through Manhattan after the meeting, Eddie starts experiencing hallucinations and the sense of time skipping forward, noticing that several hours have suddenly passed of which he has no memory. As this effect recurs over the course of the day and night he finds himself at a nightclub, a hotel party, in a hotel room with a blonde woman (<a href=""/wiki/Caroline_Winberg"" title=""Caroline Winberg"">Caroline Winberg</a>), and in a subway station where he easily subdues several muggers who attack him (thanks to the effects of NZT). When this series of blackouts finally ends, he finds himself standing on the <a href=""/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge"" title=""Brooklyn Bridge"">Brooklyn Bridge</a> at dawn, 18 hours having passed for which he cannot account. He slowly limps home. Later, Eddie sees a news report detailing the murder of the blonde woman whom he had presumably slept with, but he is unable to remember whether or not he was the killer.</p>', u'<p>Eddie meets with Melissa and discovers that she too had been on NZT. She informs him that when she attempted to stop taking it, she had experienced a severe mental <a href=""/wiki/Rebound_effect"" title=""Rebound effect"">rebound effect</a>, as well as a limp like Eddie, and that there are several people who have died after stopping dosing. On his way home, Eddie is accosted by Gennady, who takes Eddie\'s last NZT pill. Eddie visits Lindy and asks her to retrieve his backup stash, which he had hidden in her apartment. On her way back, she is followed by a man (<a href=""/wiki/Tomas_Arana"" title=""Tomas Arana"">Tomas Arana</a>) who\'d been stalking Eddie. He corners Lindy in a park and kills two random guys who try to protect her. Eddie tells her to take an NZT pill. The pill enables her to escape and she returns the stash to Eddie.</p>', u'<p>Eddie experiments with the drug and learns to control his dosage, sleep schedule and food intake to prevent side effects.

Soon afterwards, Eddie discovers that his pills are gone and begins to enter <a href=""/wiki/Drug_withdrawal"" title=""Drug withdrawal"">withdrawal</a>. He also learns that his bodyguards have been killed. But the severe effects of withdrawal cause him to hurry home when Van Loon questions him about his knowledge relating to Atwood\'s coma. Gennady breaks into his apartment, demanding more NZT. He reveals that to increase the effect\'s potency and duration he has been dissolving it in water and injecting it. Eddie stabs Gennady and licks up some of his pooling blood for the NZT it now contains. His increased mental acuity restored, Eddie kills Gennady\'s henchmen and escapes. He meets with his stalker, surmising that Atwood employed the man to locate more NZT. The two join forces and recover Eddie\'s stash from his attorney (who did not pass the NZT to his client).</p>', u'<p>A year later, Eddie has retained his wealth, his book (entitled <i><a href=""/wiki/The_Dark_Fields"" title=""The Dark Fields"">The Dark Fields</a></i>, the name of the book on which the movie is based) has been released, and he is running for the <a href=""/wiki/United_States_Senate"" title=""United States Senate"">United States Senate</a>.

Eddie implies that he has had multiple laboratories working on NZT for the purposes of reverse engineering it, as well as being able to eliminate all of the negative side-effects.

He meets Lindy at a Chinese restaurant for lunch, where his Chinese language skills with the waiter invite skepticism from Lindy as to whether he is actually off of the drug.</p>']"

When Charlie brings up the fact that they are not thieves, Josh enlists his neighbor and former childhood friend Slide, a petty criminal, to help.

2011,US,Moneyball,boxofficemojo,United States,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball,"[u'<p>The central premise of <i>Moneyball</i> is that the collected wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and the <a href=""/wiki/Front_office"" title=""Front office"">front office</a>) over the past century is subjective and often flawed. Statistics such as <a href=""/wiki/Stolen_base"" title=""Stolen base"">stolen bases</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Run_batted_in"" title=""Run batted in"">runs batted in</a>, and <a href=""/wiki/Batting_average"" title=""Batting average"">batting average</a>, typically used to gauge players, are relics of a 19th-century view of the game and the statistics available at that time. The book argues that the Oakland A\'s\' front office took advantage of more analytical gauges of player performance to field a team that could better compete against richer competitors in <a href=""/wiki/Major_League_Baseball"" title=""Major League Baseball"">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB).</p>', u'<p>Rigorous statistical analysis had demonstrated that <a href=""/wiki/On-base_percentage"" title=""On-base percentage"">on-base percentage</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Slugging_percentage"" title=""Slugging percentage"">slugging percentage</a> are better indicators of offensive success, and the A\'s became convinced that these qualities were cheaper to obtain on the open market than more historically valued qualities such as speed and contact. These observations often flew in the face of conventional baseball wisdom and the beliefs of many baseball scouts and executives.</p>', u'<p>By re-evaluating the strategies that produce wins on the field, the <a href=""/wiki/2002_Oakland_Athletics_season"" title=""2002 Oakland Athletics season"">2002 Athletics</a>, with approximately US$44 million in salary, were competitive with larger market teams such as the <a href=""/wiki/New_York_Yankees"" title=""New York Yankees"">New York Yankees</a>, who spent over US$125 million in payroll that same season. Because of the team\'s smaller revenues, Oakland is forced to find players undervalued by the market, and their system for finding value in undervalued players has proven itself thus far. This approach brought the A\'s to the playoffs in 2002 and 2003.</p>', u'<p>Several themes Lewis explored in the book include: insiders vs. outsiders (established traditionalists vs. upstart proponents of <a href=""/wiki/Sabermetrics"" title=""Sabermetrics"">sabermetrics</a>), the democratization of information causing a flattening of hierarchies, and ""the ruthless drive for efficiency that <a href=""/wiki/Capitalism"" title=""Capitalism"">capitalism</a> demands."" The book also touches on Oakland\'s underlying economic need to stay ahead of the curve; as other teams begin mirroring Beane\'s strategies to evaluate offensive talent, diminishing the Athletics\' advantage, Oakland begins looking for other undervalued baseball skills such as defensive capabilities.</p>', u'<div class=""thumb tleft"">\n<div class=""thumbinner"" style=""width:469px;""><a class=""image"" href=""/wiki/File:MONEYBALLchart.png""><img alt="""" class=""thumbimage"" data-file-height=""631"" data-file-width=""957"" height=""308"" src=""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/MONEYBALLchart.png/467px-MONEYBALLchart.png"" srcset=""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/MONEYBALLchart.png/701px-MONEYBALLchart.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/MONEYBALLchart.png/934px-MONEYBALLchart.png 2x"" width=""467""/></a>\n<div class=""thumbcaption"">\n<div class=""magnify""><a class=""internal"" href=""/wiki/File:MONEYBALLchart.png"" title=""Enlarge""></a></div>\nDistribution of team salaries in 2002.

Sabermetricians argue that a <a href=""/wiki/College_baseball"" title=""College baseball"">college baseball</a> player\'s chance of MLB success is much higher than a traditional high school draft pick. Beane maintains that high draft picks spent on high school prospects, regardless of talent or physical potential as evaluated by traditional scouting, are riskier than if they were spent on more polished college players. Lewis cites A\'s minor leaguer <a href=""/wiki/Jeremy_Bonderman"" title=""Jeremy Bonderman"">Jeremy Bonderman</a>, drafted out of high school in 2001 over Beane\'s objections, as but one example of precisely the type of draft pick Beane would avoid. Bonderman had all of the traditional ""tools"" that scouts look for, but thousands of such players have been signed by MLB organizations out of high school over the years and failed to develop. Lewis explores the A\'s approach to the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/2002_Major_League_Baseball_Draft"" title=""2002 Major League Baseball Draft"">2002 MLB Draft</a>, when the team had a run of early picks. The book documents Beane\'s often-tense discussions with his scouting staff (who favored traditional subjective evaluation of potential rather than objective sabermetrics) in preparation for the draft to the actual draft, which defied all expectations and was considered at the time a wildly successful (if unorthodox) effort by Beane.</p>', u'<p>In addition, <i>Moneyball</i> traces the history of the sabermetric movement back to such people as <a href=""/wiki/Bill_James"" title=""Bill James"">Bill James</a> (now a member of the <a href=""/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox"" title=""Boston Red Sox"">Boston Red Sox</a> <a href=""/wiki/Front_office"" title=""Front office"">front office</a>) and <a href=""/wiki/Craig_R._Wright"" title=""Craig R.

Winter learns to swim without a tail by developing a side-to-side motion like a fish, but after an x-ray Clay notices the unnatural motion is causing stress on her spine; if continued the motion will cripple and eventually kill her.</p>"", u'<p>The news comes that Kyle has been injured in an explosion and is coming home for treatment. Sawyer is excited to see him, but devastated when Kyle, depressed, skips his own welcome-back party and stays at the local Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where Dr. Cameron McCarthy (<a href=""/wiki/Morgan_Freeman"" title=""Morgan Freeman"">Morgan Freeman</a>) is developing a prosthetic leg for Kyle. Sawyer and his mother visit Kyle there but Kyle asks them to leave, which shocks and infuriates Sawyer. Kyle takes Sawyer on a walk for a deeper talk about his leg. Sawyer then asks Dr. McCarthy if he can work on making a prosthetic tail for Winter. McCarthy agrees to do so and convinces his prosthetic supplier (<a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Hanger_Prosthetics_and_Orthotics"" title=""Hanger Prosthetics and Orthotics"">Hanger Prosthetics and Orthotics</a>, which supplies Winter\'s real-life tails) to supply the parts at no cost. Dr. McCarthy manufactures a ""homemade"" model tail while waiting for the real one to arrive; however, Winter rejects it and destroys it by banging it against the pool wall.</p>', u""<p>Meanwhile Kyle gets more depressed when his friend and swimming partner, Donovan Peck, beats Kyle's old swimming records. Dr. McCarthy hears about it and persuades Kyle to go home.</p>"", u'<p>Then CMA, already in financial peril, is damaged by a hurricane. The board of directors agree to close CMA, sell the land to a real estate developer, and find homes for all the animals except Winter, who due to her condition is not wanted by anyone and may have to be euthanized. Kyle visits CMA and sees that Winter is like him, with a damaged limb. However, inspired by a girl with a prosthetic limb from <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia"" title=""Atlanta, Georgia"">Atlanta, Georgia</a> who - inspired by Winter\'s story of overcoming disability - comes to visit Winter, Sawyer envisions an event called ""Save Winter Day"" to save the facility. Clay is not sold on the idea, but reconsiders after talking with his father, Reed (<a href=""/wiki/Kris_Kristofferson"" title=""Kris Kristofferson"">Kris Kristofferson</a>). Kyle agrees to a race against Donovan Peck and persuades <a href=""/wiki/Bay_News_9"" title=""Bay News 9"">Bay News 9</a> to cover the event.</p>', u'<p>The Hanger-supplied tail finally arrives; however, Winter rejects it as well. Sawyer then figures out what the real problem is: the plastic base for the tail is irritating her skin. So Dr. McCarthy develops an alternative gel-like sock which he calls ""Winter\'s Gel"" (the real-life name of the Hanger product used to attach prosthetic limbs, which was developed during its research with Winter). Winter finally accepts this newest prosthetic tail.</p>', u""<p>At Save Winter Day, the work with Winter impresses everyone. Sawyer's teacher gives him school credit, allowing him to pass summer school. The fisherman who found Winter on the beach comes by as well. Also, the real estate developer decides to keep CMA open and financially support it. With Winter's help, Kyle then wins a swimming race against Donovan.</p>"", u""<p>The ending shows documentary footage from Winter's actual rescue.

He has a happy life, but he is also a restless dreamer, spending his time reading of famous explorers in faraway places.</p>', u'<p>One day, the Popper family tunes in to a radio broadcast by an Admiral exploring polar regions. Mr. Popper had previously sent the Admiral fan mail, and the Admiral promises Mr. Popper a surprise. The surprise turns out to be a penguin, which comes in a large box. Mr. Popper names the penguin ""Captain Cook"" after the famous <a href=""/wiki/James_Cook"" title=""James Cook"">James Cook</a>. Mr. Popper cleans out the <a href=""/wiki/Icebox"" title=""Icebox"">icebox</a> so that the penguin can sleep inside. As time goes by, the Poppers find that Captain Cook is growing large, but his health is failing. Mr. Popper writes to the curator of a large aquarium, asking for help. The curator replies that the aquarium has a female penguin, Greta, who unfortunately is also experiencing the same symptoms, and he suggests that perhaps the penguins are simply lonely. Soon after, the Poppers receive their second penguin in the mail.</p>', u""<p>The pair of penguins are revitalized by each other's presence. As both birds cannot fit into the icebox together, Mr. Popper opens the window to let in the cold winter air, creating a snow-covered habitat. As this solution will not work in springtime, Mr. Popper has the main things moved upstairs and a freezing plant installed in the basement for the birds. This makes for happy penguins, but strains the family budget.</p>"", u'<p>As time passes, Greta lays eggs. She continues laying a new egg every three days until the total reaches ten. As penguins do not normally lay so many eggs, Mr. Popper attributes this to the change in climate the birds have experienced. When the eggs hatch, the Popper family now has twelve penguins to feed, and the contractor is looking for payment on the household changes.</p>', u'<p>Mr. Popper decides to raise money by training the twelve penguins and turning them into a <a href=""/wiki/Circus"" title=""Circus"">circus</a> act. The act debuts at the local theater, and soon the ""Popper\'s Performing Penguins"" are featured throughout the country. But in the theater in <a href=""/wiki/New_York"" title=""New York"">New York</a>, the penguins cause trouble; what\'s worse, they\'ve accidentally shown up at the wrong theater.

Will is an adventurous and existentialist krill determined to discover what lies beyond the swarm. His friend, Bill, reluctantly follows him to ensure his safety. Once separated from the swarm, Will and Bill realize that krill are at the bottom of the food chain, created to be eaten. Inspired, Will ventures out to evolve and ""move up the food chain"" by eating a real creature instead of being eaten.</p>', u'<p>Mumble tells Erik that he is unique to the world and that he will someday find his calling, but Erik is oblivious. While trying to cross a perilous ice bridge, the penguins encounter Bryan the Beach Master and his two young sons, who refuse to let the penguins pass.

Mumble sets out to free Bryan by luring a <a href=""/wiki/Leopard_seal"" title=""Leopard seal"">leopard seal</a> to chase him down.

Erik attempts to deliver a fish to Gloria by flying and nearly tossing himself over the edge of the iceberg. Mumble scolds Erik for his beliefs, saying that no penguin can fly and that none of the emperor penguins will be able to escape. Once Erik realizes Emperor-Land is destined to die, he begins to break down. Gloria sends Mumble off to hunt for fish, calming Erik and the rest of the hysterical Emperor-Land.

Erik urges Sven to teach the penguins how to fly, but Sven reveals that he is not a penguin but a <a href=""/wiki/Atlantic_puffin"" title=""Atlantic puffin"">puffin</a>. He admits that after the loss of Svenland, he was lonely and grew to love the penguins who accepted him as a family. Mumble, after watching snow fall into a crevice between chunks of iceberg, begins to tap-dance on the ice and lead the Ad\xe9lie penguins in a dance to force snow between the ice and weaken it.

Megamind is consistently defeated by Metroman and is in prison. After using a holographic watch to escape with the aid of Minion, a talking fish with the robotic body of a gorilla, he kidnaps Metro Man\'s supposed love interest, reporter Roxanne Ritchi and holds her hostage to lure him into a trap. Finding that copper is Metro Man\'s one weakness, Megamind\'s plan to obliterate him with a death ray powered by the sun succeeds, and Megamind finally takes over the city. His joy is short lived though, as without a hero to fight, he finds his life has become meaningless. He goes to the Metroman Museum, which was dedicated to him on the day of his death and nearly runs into Roxanne. He uses his holographic watch to disguise himself as the museum\'s curator Bernard, and she innocently gives him the idea of creating a new superhero to take Metro Man\'s place. After creating a formula from Metroman\'s DNA, Roxanne intervenes in his plans and he accidentally injects the serum into Hal Stewart, Roxanne\'s dimwitted cameraman, who has an unrequited crush on her. Under the guise of his ""Space Dad"", Megamind tries to mold Hal into a superhero named Titan (misheard by Hal as ""Tighten""), as it was the only name he could trademark. Unfortunately, Hal\'s ambitions are crushed when he sees Roxanne and Megamind as Bernard on a date.

Megamind activates a failsafe to trap Hal in copper as it was Metro Man's weakness, but that too fails. After he escapes, Megamind pleads with Roxanne for help, and they go to Metro Man's hideout to search for clues to why the copper didn't work. Instead they find Metro Man, still alive but having been disillusioned with the life of a superhero, he chose to fake his death in order to pursue a career in music. He refuses to help despite the danger, but encourages Megamind that good will always rise up against evil. Not seeing himself as a hero, Megamind gives up and returns to prison. Meanwhile, Hal kidnaps Roxanne and holds her hostage to call Megamind out of hiding.

The company is preparing to open the season with <i><a href=""/wiki/Swan_Lake"" title=""Swan Lake"">Swan Lake</a></i>. The director, Thomas Leroy (<a href=""/wiki/Vincent_Cassel"" title=""Vincent Cassel"">Vincent Cassel</a>), has to cast a new principal dancer after forcing Beth Macintyre (<a href=""/wiki/Winona_Ryder"" title=""Winona Ryder"">Winona Ryder</a>) into retirement. Thomas wants the same ballerina to portray the innocent, fragile White Swan as well as her dark, sensual twin, the Black Swan. Nina auditions for the part, performing flawlessly as the White Swan, but not quite able to emulate the characteristics of the Black Swan. Although Nina does not do well during her audition, she approaches Thomas and asks him to reconsider her as the lead role. He tells her she is the ideal dancer to cast as the White Swan, but she lacks the passion needed to correctly portray the Black Swan.</p>', u'<p>Nina at first reluctantly accepts this and decides to leave when Thomas stops her and chides her for giving up too easily. Though he praises her technique, he criticizes her machine-like performance, saying that he has never once seen her lose herself. Nina says that she wants to be perfect, to which Thomas retorts by saying that perfection isn\'t about control, it\'s about \'letting go.\' When Thomas forcibly kisses Nina, she displays a change of character and bites him, convincing him to cast her as the Swan Queen. An intoxicated Beth angrily confronts Thomas and Nina. She is later hit by a car and seriously injured in what Thomas suspects was a suicide attempt. Nina begins to witness strange happenings. Thomas, meanwhile, becomes increasingly critical of her ""frigid"" dancing and advises her to stop being a perfectionist and to lose herself in the role. Thomas points to Lily (<a href=""/wiki/Mila_Kunis"" title=""Mila Kunis"">Mila Kunis</a>), another dancer in the company, whom he describes as lacking Nina\'s flawless technique but possessing an uninhibited quality that Nina has not shown. The relationship between the two dancers is tense because of Lily\'s indiscretions. One evening, Lily shows up at Nina\'s apartment to invite her to a night out. Nina is hesitant at first, but decides to go against her mother\'s wishes.</p>', u'<p>At a restaurant that evening, Lily offers Nina a capsule of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Ecstasy_(drug)"" title=""Ecstasy (drug)"">ecstasy</a> to help her loosen up. Though reassured its effects will only last a few hours, Nina turns it down. Lily later slips it into her drink at a nightclub while she is absent, which Nina witnesses, but decides to take the drink anyway. Nina returns home late, fights with her mother, barricades herself in her room, and has sex with Lily until the latter seemingly smothers her with a pillow. The next morning, Nina wakes up alone and late for rehearsal. When she arrives at the studio, she finds Lily dancing as the Swan Queen. Furious, she confronts Lily and asks her why she did not wake her up that morning. After Lily admits she spent the night with a man whom she met at the club, Nina realizes she dreamed the encounter. Nina\'s hallucinations become stronger as she sees Thomas and Lily have sex in a backstage area and Beth stabbing herself in the face at the hospital with a nail file which Nina drops bloodied in the elevator.</p>', u""<p>Nina later has a violent argument with her mother, after which she passes out. Concerned about Nina's erratic behavior, her mother tries to prevent her from performing on opening night; enraged, Nina stands up to her mother and forces her way out of the apartment. Since her mother had called to say Nina was sick, Thomas assigned understudy Lily to take over, but reluctantly gives way when Nina insists on performing. The first act goes well, until Nina is distracted by a hallucination during a lift, causing her partner, playing the Prince, to drop her. Distraught, she returns to her dressing room and finds Lily there. Lily announces she is to play the Black Swan. Nina shoves her into a mirror, shattering it. Lily, seemingly dead, awakens, and her face changes shape, now a copy of Nina's. The doppelganger starts to strangle Nina, who then grabs a shard of glass and stabs her rival in the stomach, apparently killing her. The doppelganger's face reverts to that of Lily's. Nina hides the body and returns to the stage to dance with passion and sensuality.</p>"", u'<p>Sprouting feathers, her arms become black wings as she finally loses herself and is transformed into a black swan. At the end of the act, she receives a standing ovation. Offstage, Thomas and the rest of the cast congratulate her on her stunning performance. Nina takes Thomas by surprise and kisses him. Back in her dressing room before the final act, Nina is congratulated by Lily, revealing that their fight was, again, imaginary. The mirror, however, is still shattered. Nina removes a small shard from her own body and realizes she had stabbed herself. Dancing the last scene, in which the White Swan throws herself off a cliff, Nina spots her mother weeping in the audience. As Nina falls backward onto a hidden mattress, the theater erupts in thunderous applause. Thomas and the cast gather to congratulate her\u2014only to find that she is bleeding. As the white ceiling lights envelop her, she whispers, ""I felt it. Perfect. It was perfect.""</p>']"

Along the way he demonstrates uncanny survival and fighting skills, hunting wildlife and swiftly defeating a group of <a href=""/wiki/Highwayman"" title=""Highwayman"">desert bandits</a> who try to ambush him. Searching for water, he arrives in a ramshackle town rebuilt and overseen by Carnegie (<a href=""/wiki/Gary_Oldman"" title=""Gary Oldman"">Gary Oldman</a>). Carnegie dreams of building more towns and of controlling the people by using the power of a certain book. His <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Henchmen"" title=""Henchmen"">henchmen</a> scour the desolate landscape daily in search of it, but to no avail.</p>', u'<p>In town he barters with a store owner, the Engineer (<a href=""/wiki/Tom_Waits"" title=""Tom Waits"">Tom Waits</a>), to recharge the battery of his portable music player. While waiting, he goes across the street to the town bar, where a gang of bikers attack, but he quickly kills them all. Realizing Eli is a literate man like himself, Carnegie asks Eli to stay, making it clear that the offer is non-negotiable. After Carnegie\'s blind mistress Claudia (<a href=""/wiki/Jennifer_Beals"" title=""Jennifer Beals"">Jennifer Beals</a>) gives Eli some food and water, Carnegie orders Claudia\'s daughter Solara (<a href=""/wiki/Mila_Kunis"" title=""Mila Kunis"">Mila Kunis</a>) to seduce Eli, but he turns her down. While killing time, she finds his book. Unperturbed, Eli offers to share his food with her, and before they eat, he says <a href=""/wiki/Grace_(prayer)"" title=""Grace (prayer)"">grace</a>. The following day, Solara repeats the prayer, but Carnegie overhears them and realizes Solara\'s words relate to the book he has been seeking. He soon forces Solara to tell him if Eli was reading a book, and realizes Eli\'s book is the one he wants\u2014a <a href=""/wiki/Bible"" title=""Bible"">Bible</a>.</p>', u""<p>Eli sneaks out of his room and Carnegie has his henchmen shoot at Eli, but the bullets seemingly just graze him, as if he is being protected. Eli shoots most of Carnegie's men and hits Carnegie in the leg with a shotgun blast. Solara, having left the town, leads Eli to a cave which is the town's water supply, hoping she can accompany him on his travels. Eli traps her inside and continues on alone. Solara escapes and soon finds herself ambushed by two bandits who attempt to rape her, but Eli reappears and kills them. As they continue on, Eli explains his mission to Solara. According to Eli, his book is the last remaining copy of the Bible, as all other copies were intentionally destroyed following the nuclear war thirty years ago. He says he was led to the book by a voice in his head, which then directed him to travel westward to a place where it would be safe. The voice assured him that he would be protected and guided on his journey.</p>"", u'<p>Eventually, Eli and Solara investigate an isolated house. They fall into a trap, but manage to allay the suspicions of the residents, George (<a href=""/wiki/Michael_Gambon"" title=""Michael Gambon"">Michael Gambon</a>) and Martha (<a href=""/wiki/Frances_de_la_Tour"" title=""Frances de la Tour"">Frances de la Tour</a>), who invite them in for tea. When Eli realizes that the couple are <a href=""/wiki/Cannibalism"" title=""Cannibalism"">cannibals</a>, they attempt to leave just as Carnegie and his henchmen arrive. In the ensuing shootout, George, Martha and many of Carnegie\'s men are killed. Eli and Solara are captured. When Carnegie threatens to kill Solara, Eli surrenders the Bible, but Carnegie shoots him, and leaves him for dead. Solara escapes and drives back to help Eli. Rather than chase her, Carnegie returns to the town, since his sole remaining vehicle is running low on fuel. Solara finds Eli, and they drive until they reach the <a href=""/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge"" title=""Golden Gate Bridge"">Golden Gate Bridge</a>, and then row to <a href=""/wiki/Alcatraz_Island"" title=""Alcatraz Island"">Alcatraz Island</a>, where they find a group intent on preserving what they can of literature and music.

Managed by his mother, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo), and trained by his older half-brother, <a href=""/wiki/Dicky_Eklund"" title=""Dicky Eklund"">Dicky Eklund</a> (Christian Bale), Micky has not had a particularly successful career: He\'s become a ""stepping stone"" for other boxers to defeat on their way up. Complicating matters, Dicky, a former boxer whose peak of success was going the distance with <a href=""/wiki/Sugar_Ray_Leonard"" title=""Sugar Ray Leonard"">Sugar Ray Leonard</a> in 1978 (before Leonard became a world champion), has fallen apart since then, becoming addicted to <a href=""/wiki/Crack_cocaine"" title=""Crack cocaine"">crack cocaine</a>. He is now being filmed for an HBO documentary he believes to be about his ""comeback"".</p>', u'<p>On the night of an <a href=""/wiki/Card_(sports)"" title=""Card (sports)"">undercard fight</a> in <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Atlantic_City"" title=""Atlantic City"">Atlantic City</a>, Micky\'s scheduled opponent is ill, and a substitute is found who is 20 pounds heavier than Micky, a huge difference in professional boxing, constituting two or three weight classes. Despite Micky\'s reservations, his mother and brother agree to the terms so that they can all get the purse. Micky is soundly defeated by the much heavier fighter in an obvious mismatch. Frustrated with his career and embarrassed by his defeat, Micky tries to retreat from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender.</p>', u'<p>After several weeks, Alice arranges another fight for Micky, who hesitates, concerned it will turn out the same as before. His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation. Micky mentions that he\'s received an offer to be paid to train in <a href=""/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley"" title=""Las Vegas Valley"">Las Vegas</a>, but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family. Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then, once she picks up a client, <a href=""/wiki/Police_impersonation"" title=""Police impersonation"">impersonating a police officer</a> to steal the client\'s money. This is quickly foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them. Micky intervenes to try to stop the police from beating his brother, and a police officer breaks his hand before arresting him. At their arraignment, Micky is released but Dicky is sent to jail. Finally fed up, Micky washes his hands of Dicky.</p>', u'<p>On the night of the HBO documentary\'s airing, Dicky\'s family, and Dicky himself in prison, are horrified to see it is called <i><a href=""/wiki/High_on_Crack_Street:_Lost_Lives_in_Lowell"" title=""High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell"">Crack in America</a></i> and about how crack addiction ruined Dicky\'s career and life. Devastated, Dicky begins training and trying to get his life together in prison. Micky is lured back into boxing by his father, who believes Alice and his stepson Dicky are bad influences. The other members of his training team and a new manager, Sal Lanano, persuade Micky to return to boxing with the explicit understanding that his mother and brother will no longer be involved. They place Micky in minor fights to help him regain his confidence. He is then offered another major fight against an undefeated up-and-coming boxer. During a prison visit, Dicky advises Micky on how best to work his opponent, but Micky feels his brother is being selfish and trying to restart his own failed career. During the actual match, Micky is nearly overwhelmed at the beginning but then implements his brother\'s advice and is eventually triumphant; he earns the title shot for which his opponent was being groomed.</p>', u'<p>Upon his release from prison, Dicky and his mother go to see Micky train. Assuming things are as they were, Dicky prepares to spar with his brother, but Micky informs him that he\'s no longer allowed per Micky\'s agreement with his current team. In the ensuing argument, in which Micky chastises both factions of his family, Charlene and his trainer leave in disgust. Micky and Dicky spar until Micky knocks Dicky down. Dicky storms off, presumably to get high again, and Alice chides Micky, only to be sobered when he tells her that she has always favored Dicky. Dicky returns to his crack house, where he says goodbye to his friends and heads to Charlene\'s apartment. He tells her that Micky needs both of them and they need to work together. After bringing everyone back together, the group goes to <a href=""/wiki/London"" title=""London"">London</a> for the title fight. Micky scores another upset victory and the welterweight title. The film jumps a few years ahead, with Dicky, as talkative as ever, crediting his brother as the creator of his own success.</p>']"

He also recounts his chance to be a professional hockey player which he threw away for a life of crime, following in his father\'s footsteps. She in turn tells Doug that she saw a tattoo on one of the robbers, and he realizes that she can identify Jem and send them all to jail.

The gang is interrogated by Frawley, but he fails to get any confessions and is forced to release them. Doug asks Claire if she will go away with him, and she agrees. When Frawley learns that Claire quit her job, he wiretaps her phone, and threatens to prosecute her as an accomplice after realizing that she is seeing Doug. Shocked to discover that her lover was one of her assailants, she is forced to cooperate with the FBI and breaks up with Doug. Meanwhile, Fergie and Jem are pressuring Doug about the next heist, but Doug is determined to get out. Fergie threatens to kill Claire if Doug does not go through with the job, and reveals to Doug how he controlled his father by making his mother an addict, which led to her suicide.

Doug flees, donning an <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/MBTA"" title=""MBTA"">MBTA</a> uniform and escaping on a train. Later, Claire finds a bag containing the stolen money, a tangerine, and a note from Doug, suggesting that she can make better use of the money than he can.

Dewey and Gilleece manage to catch up to 777 using a high-railing truck, but fail to board the train in time.

Completely taken with Miller, Havens goes to the restroom to prep herself up. Meanwhile, Miller fights and kills everyone else on the plane, even the pilots, who were all agents sent by Fitzgerald. After Havens reemerges and gives him a kiss, Miller crash-lands the plane in a cornfield. He drugs a shocked and confused Havens, warning her about the agents who will come after her and that she is not safe with them.</p>', u'<p>Waking up at home, Havens struggles through a day fitting a <a href=""/wiki/Bridesmaid"" title=""Bridesmaid"">bridesmaid</a>\'s dress for her sister\'s <a href=""/wiki/Wedding"" title=""Wedding"">wedding</a>, and is shocked to learn her sister would like to sell their father\'s <a href=""/wiki/Pontiac_GTO"" title=""Pontiac GTO"">Pontiac GTO tri-power</a>, which Havens had planned on finishing as a wedding present.

Accepting a call from her sister after leaving in frustration, Havens accidentally leads Quintana\'s men straight to the hideaway. They try to kill Miller and Havens with an unmanned aerial vehicle.

Impressed by Tim\'s ingenuity, his boss Lance Fender (<a href=""/wiki/Bruce_Greenwood"" title=""Bruce Greenwood"">Bruce Greenwood</a>) invites him to a ""dinner for winners"" in which he must find and bring an eccentric person with a special talent; the winner earns a trophy and the executive that brought him or her gets glory. He soon learns it is more of a ""dinner for idiots"", and the partygoers will be mocked mercilessly. Meanwhile, Tim\'s girlfriend Julie (<a href=""/wiki/Stephanie_Szostak"" title=""Stephanie Szostak"">Stephanie Szostak</a>) lands a curator deal for eccentric artist Kieran Vollard (<a href=""/wiki/Jemaine_Clement"" title=""Jemaine Clement"">Jemaine Clement</a>), and Tim unsuccessfully proposes to her, as he has done several times before.

Tim then tells Barry everything and, after some encouragement, gets Barry to win with ""brain control"", before causing his boss and fellow executives to reveal the truth. A guest reacts badly to the news and inadvertently causes chaos in the process, with Mueller losing a finger. A fire breaks out, while a bird brought by one of the guests flies away with Mueller\'s finger. Tim is fired, as is Julie after Barry makes Vollard realize it would be a problem to have her continue working for him. In the end, Tim marries Julie, Barry enters into a relationship with Darla, does some artwork with Vollard, and hosts a monthly ""breakfast for champions"" for all of the losers.

Acheson has spent years hunting Alexander Pearce, a lover of Elise, who owes \xa3744 million in <a href=""/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_Kingdom"" title=""Taxation in the United Kingdom"">back taxes</a>, and is believed to have received <a href=""/wiki/Plastic_surgery"" title=""Plastic surgery"">plastic surgery</a> to alter his appearance. At a Parisian cafe, Elise receives written instructions from Pearce: Board the train to <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Venice,_Italy"" title=""Venice, Italy"">Venice</a>; pick out a man; let the police believe that he is Pearce.

She spends much time with him, seeming to start a romance. Meanwhile, the police have managed to salvage the ashes of her burned note and assembled them to extract information regarding her rendezvous, as well as her ruse. Aware of her location, but not of the ruse, an informer from the police station communicates to Reginald Shaw (<a href=""/wiki/Steven_Berkoff"" title=""Steven Berkoff"">Steven Berkoff</a>), the mobster from whom Pearce stole $2.3 billion, that Pearce is traveling with Elise on the train to Venice. Shaw immediately proceeds to Venice.</p>', u'<p>Elise invites Frank to stay with her at her suite in the <a href=""/wiki/Hotel_Danieli"" title=""Hotel Danieli"">Hotel Danieli</a> in Venice. Pearce leaves further instructions for Elise to attend a ball. Elise abandons Frank, who is then chased by Shaw\'s men. While trying to escape from them, Frank is detained by the Italian police, ostensibly for his own safety, only to have a corrupt inspector turn him over to Shaw\'s men in exchange for the bounty that has been placed on Pearce\'s head. Elise rescues Frank just before he is handed over, leading Shaw\'s men on an extended boat chase and finally escaping. She leaves Frank at the airport with his passport and money, urging him to go home for his own safety.</p>', u'<p>Elise is revealed to be an undercover Scotland Yard agent who was under suspension for her suspected sympathies with Pearce. She agrees to participate in a sting operation. At the ball, as Elise tries to spot Pearce in the crowd, an envelope is placed on the table in front of her, but the man (<a href=""/wiki/Rufus_Sewell"" title=""Rufus Sewell"">Rufus Sewell</a>) disappears into the crowd. She tries to follow him through the crowd, but is stopped by Frank. Frank claims to be in love with Elise and invites her to dance with him. After the police surprise Frank, Elise reads the note. She leaves suddenly in her boat to be tailed by Shaw. Both parties are followed by the police. Frank is held handcuffed.</p>', u'<p>When Elise arrives at the destination, Shaw takes her prisoner, threatening to harm her unless she reveals the location of the stolen money. The police monitor the situation inside the rendezvous room through audio and video links. Despite Elise\'s peril, Acheson repeatedly turns down police requests to intervene with their snipers. While the police are occupied in monitoring the situation, Frank escapes from the police boat and confronts Shaw, claiming to be Pearce and offering to open the safe if Elise is allowed to leave safely. Shaw is skeptical and makes a counter offer that Frank should open the safe if he does not want to see Elise tortured by his men. Chief Inspector Jones (<a href=""/wiki/Timothy_Dalton"" title=""Timothy Dalton"">Timothy Dalton</a>) arrives at the police stake-out, overrides Acheson, and orders the snipers to fire, killing Shaw and his men. To Elise\'s obvious pleasure, Jones lifts her suspension and terminates her employment.</p>', u'<p>Acheson, receiving a message that Pearce has been found near their position, rushes to find the police have detained an Englishman. The man, Lawrence Mason, says he is a tourist following written instructions received via his mobile phone, for which he has been receiving payments. Elise tells Frank that she loves him, but she also loves Pearce. Frank then suggests a ""solution"" to this dilemma; to Elise\'s surprise, he opens the safe by entering the correct code, thus revealing that he is really Alexander Pearce. When the police open the safe they find only one cheque: It is for \xa3744 million. Acheson prepares to chase after Pearce, but Jones overrides him, reasoning that with the taxes now paid in full, Pearce\'s only crime is that he stole money from a now-dead gangster. Jones orders the case to be closed, much to Acheson\'s frustration. Frank (Alexander) and Elise sail away together.</p>']"

Greg refuses, dishonestly claiming that he is allergic to cheese and will die if he eats it, thus leaving Rowley to eat it. The teens then leave. The other students notice that the Cheese is gone, assuming that someone has destroyed it; however, Greg says he just picked it up and threw it away, because he was sick of it sitting there so all suspicion towards Rowley is deflected as he feels pity on him, which then gives Greg the ""Cheese Touch"".

Soren enjoys listening to the \'Legends of Ga\'Hoole,\' which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones. Kludd berates his brother\'s dreams, having grown tired of listening to the stories. When their father teaches them the first steps to flying, Kludd becomes jealous of Soren\'s natural branching ability. Later, when practicing branching while their parents are hunting, Kludd pushes Soren off a branch which forces them both to fall to the ground. They are attacked by a <a href=""/wiki/Tasmanian_devil"" title=""Tasmanian devil"">Tasmanian devil</a> but are saved, and then kidnapped, by two owls, Jatt and Jutt.</p>', u'<p>Along the way, more owlets are revealed to have been kidnapped. Soren meets Gylfie, a young <a href=""/wiki/Elf_owl"" title=""Elf owl"">Elf owl</a> who is also kidnapped. At St. Aegolius, the owlets are greeted by Nyra, who says that they will be divided into either soldiers or \'pickers\'. When Soren and Gylfie protest, they are sorted as pickers while Kludd, who betrays Soren, is sent to be a soldier. Soren and Gylfie avoid being \'moon-blinked\' (a catatonic state induced by sleeping under a full moon), while the others do not know and become moon-blinked. They are forced to \'pick\' through owl\'s pellets, scouring for bits of metal \'<a href=""/wiki/Magnetism"" title=""Magnetism"">flecks</a>\', which are being used to build a superweapon. They are spotted by Grimble, a <a href=""/wiki/Boreal_owl"" title=""Boreal owl"">Boreal owl</a>, who reveals that he works under the Pure Ones only to keep his family safe and that he isn\'t really a Pure One at all. He teaches them to fly, but Nyra finds out whilst coming to invite Soren to become a soldier. Kludd decides to stay behind and become a Pure One, despite Soren\'s pleas for him to come with him. Grimble and Nyra engage in a battle, but Grimble is eventually killed. Following his instructions to seek the Great Tree of Ga\'Hoole and warn the Guardians, Soren and Gylfie fly out. Along their journey, they meet Twilight, a <a href=""/wiki/Great_grey_owl"" title=""Great grey owl"">Great grey owl</a>, and Digger, a <a href=""/wiki/Burrowing_owl"" title=""Burrowing owl"">Burrowing owl</a>, and rest with them in their shared hollow. Soren is reunited with Mrs. P who is brought in by Twilight, having captured her for dinner while she searched for them. She agrees to go with them to find the Guardians.</p>', u'<p>The band flies towards the sea of <a href=""/wiki/Bass_Strait"" title=""Bass Strait"">Hoolemere</a> where a flock of crows chaotically guides them to the legendary shrine and gateway of the Guardians, kept by an oracular <a href=""/wiki/Echidna"" title=""Echidna"">echidna</a>, who provides comic, but accurate, descriptions of the quintet and guidance to the object of their quest. He sends the owls out to sea to find the island of Ga\'Hoole. En route, the band encounters a fierce storm and Digger\'s wings freeze, causing him to nearly drown in the sea, but they are saved by Boron and Barran, the king and queen of the Guardians who lead them back to the Tree of Ga\'Hoole. There, Soren tells the Guardian council about the Pure One\'s plans. The Guardians are skeptical, but an elderly Screech owl named Ezylryb is convinced by Soren\'s sincerity. Boron sends a Great grey owl called Allomere out with two scouts to investigate St. Aegolius.</p>', u'<p>The band is shown refuge at the Tree of Ga\'Hoole, guided by a young Guardian-in-training named Otulissa, a <a href=""/wiki/Short-eared_owl"" title=""Short-eared owl"">Short-eared owl</a>. Soren develops a crush on her, to Gylfie\'s annoyance. They are sent to attend different classes called \'chaws\'. During one lesson in the middle of a rainstorm, Soren grasps a brief hold on gizzard-flying (flying purely with instinct), but loses control and falls towards the sea. Ezylryb rescues him and orders Soren back to his hollow. There, Soren learns that Ezylryb is, in fact, the Lyze of Kiel; the legendary leader of the Guardians who fought and defeated Metal Beak, the ancient leader of the Pure Ones, and Nyra\'s mate. But Soren is disheartened when he learns that his hero is a battle worn veteran who scoffs at his own past. Allomere returns from his scouting mission with news that his two wingmen were killed in an ambush. He brings back with him two moon-blinked owlets, one of which is Soren\'s sister, Eglantine. Seeing the evidence, the Guardians arrange for battle and fly out towards St. Aegolius. Before leaving, Ezylryb instructs an anxious Soren to tend to his sister. When she finally snaps out of her trance, Eglantine tells Soren that it was Kludd who moon-blinked her and gave her to Allomere, and he realizes that Allomere is a traitor and that the Guardians are actually flying into a trap. The band then follows the Guardians where they find the Guardians subdued by the flecks, contained in a machine operated by bats.</p>', u""<p>Twilight, Gylfie and Digger fend off the bats sent by Metal Beak to kill the paralyzed Guardians. This causes Metal Beak to distrust Allomere, and, believing he lied to him about bringing all the Guardians, has him dragged away by several bats, and is seemly killed in the darkness. Meanwhile, Soren flies through a forest fire, igniting a lamp of oil, and manages to disable the fleck trap. Freed and recovered, the Guardians fly into battle and Ezylryb goes straight for Metal Beak, who with Nyra begins to overpower him. Soren flies into the battle after spotting Kludd, but Kludd attacks him, throwing him into the forest fire. The two brothers briefly fight while Soren tries to talk some sense into Kludd but Kludd replies that the Pure Ones believe in him like no one ever has and how Metal Beak said that the strong with triumph, the broken will be put out of their misery and that honor is just another word for weakness. Soren replies that he knows that Kludd doesn't think like that to which Kludd replies that Soren doesn't know him at all, before he leaps onto Soren, causing them to fall down a tree. Injured, Kludd tries to trick Soren to help him up, but as he attempts to do so, Kludd attacks him again, only for the branch Kludd is holding onto to snap, causing him to fall into the fire and disappear, seemingly killed. Furious at Kludd's apparent death and betrayal, Soren grabs a flaming branch and attacks Metal Beak. Metal Beak easily has the upper hand on Soren, but grows over-confident and Soren manages to kill him, impaling him with the branch when he dives at Soren. Nyra, shocked at her mate's death, retreats with the remaining Pure Ones.</p>"", u'<p>When they return to the tree, Soren and Eglantine are reunited with their parents, who have come to the tree. The band is then welcomed as new Guardians. Soren states that whilst Metal Beak was defeated, Nyra escaped and Kludd\'s body was never found. Meanwhile, back in the smoking remains of the canyons, a shadowy owl; presumably Kludd, is shown staring at the mask of Metal Beak with red ""Pure One"" eyes.</p>']"
