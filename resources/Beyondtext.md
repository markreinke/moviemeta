## Ideas outside of text mining that we may want to pursue

### Movie Graph
Let's say two movies are connected if they share the director, scriptwriter or main actors. We could look for patterns in such a graph at a large scale. Note that we can inporporate the topic similarity also in this graph structure.

Maybe it is possible to also use the graph to validate the predictions made from the topic detection. If topic detection declares two movies as similar and these movies are also highly connected in the graph, then that is an indication that the algorithm performed well.
