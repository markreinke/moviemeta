Hiccup, however, refuses to believe that war is inevitable. After Stoick interrupts Hiccup's plan to get Eret to take him to Drago, Stoick explains that he once met Drago at a gathering of chiefs, where Drago, mocked after offering the chiefs his service in return for their servitude, murdered them all, with Stoick as the only survivor.

Agnes\u2019 friend Philomena Nine Warts informs her that her grandmother, Mary Moccasin, was next to Agnes\u2019 grandmother at the tax office when she paid the bill and therefore no money is owed.

Augustus suggests that she use her ""cancer wish"" since children and young adults with life-threatening illnesses receive one arranged experience of their choice, but Hazel explains that she already used hers to visit <a href=""/wiki/Disneyland"" title=""Disneyland"">Disneyland</a> when she was younger.

During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they get the bus into the city and head to Van Houten\'s house, but are soon shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic; Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner on his behalf without him knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant\'s actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers to a piece of fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly destraught. On their way back to the hotel, Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the <a href=""/wiki/Anne_Frank_House"" title=""Anne Frank House"">Anne Frank House</a>, where Hazel struggles to climb the house\'s many stairs. At the end of the tour, Augustus and Hazel kiss to the applause of many fellow tourists. They spend that night together in their hotel and make love for the first time.

Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.</p>', u'<p>After their return to Indianapolis, Augustus\' health worsens each week. Hazel receives a desperate call from him late at night after he tries to get a new pack of cigarettes at the gas station. He is taken to the ICU for a few days and realizes he is close to death. Augustus invites his blind best friend Isaac (<a href=""/wiki/Nat_Wolff"" title=""Nat Wolff"">Nat Wolff</a>) and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they deliver eulogies they\'ve both prepared. Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time together for anything, since he ""gave me a forever within the numbered days.""</p>', u'<p>Augustus dies eight days later. At his funeral, Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten in attendance. He tells her he maintained correspondence with Augustus after Amsterdam and that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip. He then tells Hazel that his novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died from leukemia at a young age. Van Houten tries to tell Hazel about the fate of Anna\'s mother; he gives Hazel a piece of paper. Hazel, still upset with his behavior in Amsterdam, crumples up the paper and asks him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her. She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads Augustus\' words, which state his acceptance of death and his love for Hazel. Hazel lies on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars, smiling as she remembers Augustus and says ""Okay"".</p>', u'<h3><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""An_Imperial_Affliction""><i>An Imperial Affliction</i></span><span class=""mw-editsection""><span class=""mw-editsection-bracket"">[</span><a href=""/w/index.php?title=The_Fault_in_Our_Stars_(film)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2"" title=""Edit section: An Imperial Affliction"">edit</a><span class=""mw-editsection-bracket"">]</span></span></h3>', u'<p>The book <i>An Imperial Affliction</i>, which features within both the original novel and the film, is fictitious, as is its author Peter Van Houten; both are used to enhance the themes and story.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>', u'<h3><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Differences_between_the_novel_and_film"">Differences between the novel and film</span><span class=""mw-editsection""><span class=""mw-editsection-bracket"">[</span><a href=""/w/index.php?title=The_Fault_in_Our_Stars_(film)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3"" title=""Edit section: Differences between the novel and film"">edit</a><span class=""mw-editsection-bracket"">]</span></span></h3>', u'<p>According to Lindsey Weber of <i><a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Vulture.com"" title=""Vulture.com"">Vulture.com</a></i>, the differences between the book and the film include Hazel mentioning the band the <i>Hectic Glow</i> many times in the book, but not in the film.

Zubrowka is on the verge of war, but such a matter is of little concern to Monsieur Gustave H., the Grand Budapest\'s devoted concierge. The owner of the hotel is unknown and only relays important messages through the lawyer Deputy Kovacs.

The boys, who call themselves Gladers, have formed a rudimentary society with each assuming specialized tasks. Alby, their leader and the first to arrive in the Glade, says every boy eventually recalls his name, but none remember their past.

Ben is forced into the Maze and left to die as there is no cure for what the Griever infected him with. Minho, the lead Runner, and Alby later retrace Ben's steps inside the Maze. Minho reappears at dusk dragging Alby, who is stung, but they are unable to reach the closing entrance in time. Thomas spontaneously runs into the Maze to help but all three are trapped. During the night in the Maze, Thomas and Minho tie Alby up high on the Maze wall to hide him from the Grievers, but Minho abandons Thomas when a Griever emerges from the center of the Maze. Thomas slides under the Maze wall, managing to hide from a Griever. Later, Thomas finds Minho and his actions during the night keeps them alive, and he kills a Griever by tricking it into a narrow, closing passageway thus causing it to be crushed, making him the first to ever survive a night in the Maze and kill a Griever.

Gally claims Thomas has jeopardized the fragile peace between the Gladers and the Grievers and wants him punished, but Newt, the group\'s second-in-command, instead designates Thomas a Runner. Minho shows Thomas a scale model of the Maze he has built, based on his three years of exploration. The Maze\'s numbered sections open and close in a regular sequence that might be a code.

Thomas, who has had disconnected memory flashes since arriving, stabs himself with a severed Griever stinger in an attempt to revive his memory. The others inject him with the last anti-venom.

Delirious from a Griever sting, he insists they must stay in the Maze, then aims at Thomas intending to kill him in revenge for the Glade\'s destruction.

A High Priestess of <a href=""/wiki/Sekhmet"" title=""Sekhmet"">Sekhmet</a> (the war goddess) <a href=""/wiki/Haruspex"" title=""Haruspex"">divines a prophecy from animal intestines</a>, which she relates to Ramesses\' father, <a href=""/wiki/Seti_I"" title=""Seti I"">Seti I</a>. He tells the two men of the prophecy, in which one (of Moses and Ramesses) will save the other and become a leader. During <a href=""/wiki/Battle_of_Kadesh"" title=""Battle of Kadesh"">the attack on the Hittites</a>, Moses saves Ramesses\' life, leaving both men troubled. Later, Moses is sent to the city of <a href=""/wiki/Pithom"" title=""Pithom"">Pithom</a> to meet with the Viceroy Hegep, who oversees the Hebrew slaves. Upon his arrival, he encounters the slave <a href=""/wiki/Joshua"" title=""Joshua"">Joshua</a>, who is the descendant of Joseph, and Moses is appalled by the horrific conditions of the slaves. Shortly afterwards, Moses meets <a href=""/wiki/Nun_(biblical_figure)"" title=""Nun (biblical figure)"">Nun</a>, who informs him of his true lineage; he is the child of Hebrew parents who was sent by his sister <a href=""/wiki/Miriam"" title=""Miriam"">Miriam</a> to be raised by Pharaoh\'s daughter. Moses is stunned at the revelation and leaves angrily. However, two Hebrews also overhear Nun\'s story and report their discovery to Hegep.</p>', u'<p>Seti dies soon after Moses\' return to <a href=""/wiki/Memphis,_Egypt"" title=""Memphis, Egypt"">Memphis</a>, and Ramesses becomes the new <a href=""/wiki/Pharaoh"" title=""Pharaoh"">Pharaoh</a> (Ramesses II). Hegep arrives to reveal Moses\' true identity, but Ramesses is conflicted about whether to believe the story. At the urging of <a href=""/wiki/Tuya_(queen)"" title=""Tuya (queen)"">Queen Tuya</a>, he interrogates the servant Miriam, who denies being Moses\' sister. When Ramesses threatens to cut off Miriam\'s arm, Moses comes to her defense, revealing he is a Hebrew. Although Tuya wants Moses to be put to death, Ramesses decides to send him into exile. Before leaving Egypt, Moses meets with his adopted mother and Miriam, who refer to him by his birth name of <i>Moishe.</i> Following a journey into the desert, Moses comes to <a href=""/wiki/Midian"" title=""Midian"">Midian</a> where he meets <a href=""/wiki/Zipporah"" title=""Zipporah"">Zipporah</a> and her father, <a href=""/wiki/Jethro_(Bible)"" title=""Jethro (Bible)"">Jethro</a>. Moses becomes a shepherd, marries Zipporah and has a son <a href=""/wiki/Gershom"" title=""Gershom"">Gershom</a>.</p>', u'<p>Nine years later, Moses gets injured during a rockslide. He comes face to face with a <a href=""/wiki/Burning_bush"" title=""Burning bush"">burning bush</a> and a boy called <a href=""/wiki/Angel_of_the_Lord"" title=""Angel of the Lord"">Malak</a>, who serves as a representative of the God of Abraham. While recovering, Moses confesses his past to Zipporah and reveals what God has asked him to do. This drives a wedge between the couple, because Zipporah fears he will leave their family. After he arrives in Egypt, Moses reunites with Nun and Joshua, as well as meeting his brother <a href=""/wiki/Aaron"" title=""Aaron"">Aaron</a> for the first time. Moses returns to confront Ramesses, demanding the Hebrews be released from servitude. Ramesses refuses to listen, insisting that to free the slaves would be economically impossible. Upon Moses threatening Ramesses life, Ramesses orders the death of Moses, executing random Hebrew families until he is found. Using his military skills, Moses trains the slaves in the art of war. The Hebrews start attacking the Egyptians, prompting Ramesses to raid slave villages. Malak appears to Moses and explains that <a href=""/wiki/Plagues_of_Egypt"" title=""Plagues of Egypt"">ten plagues</a> will affect Egypt. All the water in the land turns to blood, and the Egyptians are further afflicted by the arrival of frogs, lice, and flies. The plagues of the death of livestock, boils, hail and thunder, locusts, and darkness continue to affect the Egyptians. While conversing with Malak, Moses is horrified at learning the tenth plague will be the death of all firstborn children. The Hebrews protect themselves by covering their doors with the blood of lambs, as instructed by Moses. Ramesses is devastated over his son\'s death and relents, telling Moses and the Hebrews to leave.</p>', u'<p>During the exodus from Egypt, the Hebrews follow Moses\' original path through the desert and towards the <a href=""/wiki/Red_Sea"" title=""Red Sea"">Red Sea</a>. Still grieving for his son, Ramesses decides to go after the Hebrews with his army. After making their way through a dangerous mountain pass, Moses and the Hebrews arrive at the edge of the sea, uncertain about what to do. Moses flings his sword into the water, which begins to recede. Ramesses and his army pursue the Hebrews, but Moses stays behind to confront them. The Red Sea reverts to its normal state, drowning the majority of the Egyptians (<a href=""/wiki/Crossing_the_Red_Sea"" title=""Crossing the Red Sea"">crossing the Red Sea</a>). Moses survives and makes his way back to the Hebrews. Ramesses is revealed to have survived, but he is distraught over the destruction of his army. Moses leads the Hebrews back to Midian, where he reunites with Zipporah and Gershom.

The remaining population are the Factionless, who have no status or privilege in this society. When children reach the age of 16, they undergo a <a href=""/wiki/Human_serum_albumin"" title=""Human serum albumin"">serum</a>-induced psychological test which indicates their best-suited faction, then are allowed to choose any faction as their permanent group at the subsequent Choosing Ceremony.</p>', u'<p>Beatrice Prior (<a href=""/wiki/Shailene_Woodley"" title=""Shailene Woodley"">Shailene Woodley</a>) was born into Abnegation, which runs the government. Her father, Andrew Prior (<a href=""/wiki/Tony_Goldwyn"" title=""Tony Goldwyn"">Tony Goldwyn</a>), serves on the ruling council along with the head of Abnegation, Marcus Eaton (<a href=""/wiki/Ray_Stevenson_(actor)"" title=""Ray Stevenson (actor)"">Ray Stevenson</a>). Beatrice takes her test with a Dauntless woman named Tori Wu (<a href=""/wiki/Maggie_Q"" title=""Maggie Q"">Maggie Q</a>) as her proctor. Her results show attributes of multiple factions, meaning she is Divergent. Her divergence includes Abnegation, Erudite, and Dauntless. Tori records her results as Abnegation and warns her to keep the true result a secret, saying that because Divergents can think independently and the government therefore cannot control them, they are considered threats to the existing social order.</p>', u'<p>The next day at the Choosing Ceremony, Beatrice\'s brother Caleb Prior (<a href=""/wiki/Ansel_Elgort"" title=""Ansel Elgort"">Ansel Elgort</a>) chooses Erudite, while after some hesitation, Beatrice chooses Dauntless. After the ceremony, Beatrice meets Christina (<a href=""/wiki/Zo%C3%AB_Kravitz"" title=""Zo\xeb Kravitz"">Zo\xeb Kravitz</a>), Al (<a href=""/wiki/Christian_Madsen"" title=""Christian Madsen"">Christian Madsen</a>), and Will (<a href=""/wiki/Ben_Lloyd-Hughes"" title=""Ben Lloyd-Hughes"">Ben Lloyd-Hughes</a>), three other initiates from other factions who also chose Dauntless. Christina and Al are from Candor and Will is from Erudite. The initiates\' commitment and fearlessness are immediately tested, and Eric Coulter (<a href=""/wiki/Jai_Courtney"" title=""Jai Courtney"">Jai Courtney</a>), a brutal Dauntless leader, makes it clear that anyone not meeting Dauntless\' high expectations will be expelled from the faction. Beatrice is the first to volunteer for a leap of faith from a tall building into a dark hole, landing in a net.

Tris' divergence allows her to excel at the tests, defeating them in unusual ways, but Four warns her to hide her abilities and solve the challenges as a normal Dauntless would. Divergents can also manipulate tests and serums.</p>"", u'<p>Tris visits her brother Caleb, who tells her that Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation and become the ruling faction. On her return to Dauntless headquarters, Tris is attacked by Al, Peter, and Drew before being rescued by Four.

He later kills himself by jumping into ""The Chasm"" rather than face failure.</p>', u'<p>To prepare her for the final test, Four takes Tris into his own fear simulations, where she learns that his real name is Tobias Eaton, the son of Marcus Eaton.

While the Dauntless move to raid Abnegation, Tris and Four separate from the group and attempt to locate Tris\' parents, but Eric sees that Four is not under control and captures the two. Four is taken into custody while Tris is ordered to be executed. Her mother Natalie (<a href=""/wiki/Ashley_Judd"" title=""Ashley Judd"">Ashley Judd</a>) appears and saves her but is shot and killed as they try to escape.</p>', u'<p>Tris finds her father in hiding with Caleb, Marcus, and several Abnegations.

Tink willingly gives the pixie dust up, and Hook sprinkles it over the ship before throwing Zarina into the water, leaving the fairies to rescue her.

Zarina returns the blue pixie dust to Tink and her friends, before preparing to leave. However, she is offered the chance to return to Pixie Hollow and this time accepts, and helps her friends to sail the ship back to Pixie Hollow where the others are waking up with no recollection of what had happened. Zarina promises not to tamper and experiment with pixie dust again, but is convinced by Tink to show off her astoundingly profound pixie dust abilities one last time. Zarina does so, and in the process, gives Tink and her friends back their original fairy talents, allowing them to put on a beautiful performance to the audience at the Four Seasons Festival.

He relocates Flint, his friends, and the citizens of Swallow Falls to San Franjose, California. Unbeknownst to Flint, the FLDSMDFR survived the explosion and landed in the center of the island, and Chester is determined to find it. Chester invites Flint, his biggest fan, to work at Live Corp, where he meets Chester\'s assistant Barb, a talking orangutan with human intelligence. Six months later, Flint humiliates himself during a promotion ceremony when his invention, the ""Celebrationator"", explodes. Meanwhile, Chester is informed that his search-parties on the island have been attacked by monstrous cheeseburgers named Cheespiders (a combination of a Cheeseburger and a Spider) which are learning how to swim. Seemingly fearing the world\'s inevitable doom, Chester tasks Flint to find the FLDSMDFR and destroy it once and for all. Despite Chester\'s demands to keep the mission classified, Flint recruits his girlfriend, meteorologist Sam Sparks; her cameraman Manny; police officer Earl Devereaux; Steve, a monkey who communicates via a device on his chest; and ""Chicken"" Brent. Much to Flint\'s dismay, his father Tim joins the crew and they travel to Swallow Falls on his fishing boat.</p>', u'<p>Upon arriving back at Swallow Falls, they notice that a jungle-like environment made of food has overgrown the island. Tim stays behind while Flint and the others investigate, finding a vast habitat of living food animals called foodimals and meet a cute strawberry named Barry (named by Sam). Tim, searching for sardines at his abandoned tackle shop, encounters a family of humanoid pickles and bonds with them by fishing. Chester discovers that Flint allowed his friends to join him on the mission, so he travels to the island with Barb, chagrined and determined to separate them, and he arrives just in time to save them from a Cheespider. Flint then finds his old lab and invents a device to find the FLDSMDFR. After escaping a Tacodile attack, Sam notices that the foodimal was protecting its family, and begins to suspect Chester is up to no good. Sam attempts to convince Flint to spare the foodimals, but Flint is intent on making Chester proud. Sam leaves in anger, and Flint\'s other companions go with her (including Steve). In the jungle, Manny confirms Sam\'s suspicions when he reverses the Live Corp logo to reveal the ""Live"" as ""Evil"" spelled backwards.

Flint is taken to his father, and they and the foodimals all work together to allow Flint and Barry to infiltrate the Evil Corp building that is under construction on the island.

Rose is given a chance to prove that she is a stripper by dancing, and when she gets close, turns a steam vent onto Chacon allowing the Millers to escape in the RV with Kenny behind the wheel. Due to Kenny\'s erratic driving, the RV veers off the highway and a tarantula, hiding in a bowl of fruit, crawls up Kenny\'s leg and bites his testicle.</p>', u'<p>Kenny has a severe <a href=""/wiki/Allergy"" title=""Allergy"">allergic reaction</a> to the bite, and the Millers head to the hospital. This further delays the delivery of the <a href=""/wiki/Contraband"" title=""Contraband"">contraband</a>, but David renegotiates with Gurdlinger for a fee of $500,000 on the condition that it arrives that night. When Kenny is finally released, David rushes him to the RV in a wheelchair and accidentally tips him over. In the ensuing argument, David inadvertently reveals how much he is getting paid, in comparison to how little he offered to pay each of the others. Casey, Rose, and Kenny are left in disgust by the revelation, and so David leaves them at the local carnival.</p>', u'<p>Shortly after leaving, David regrets abandoning them after hearing <a href=""/wiki/Waterfalls_(TLC_song)"" title=""Waterfalls (TLC song)"">""Waterfalls"" by TLC</a> on the radio and returns to the carnival, begging them to come back with him and offering each a full share of the profits. On their way to the RV, they encounter Edith and Melissa. In the ensuing conversation between the Millers and the Fitzgeralds, Kenny blurts out that they are smuggling the pot. One-Eye appears and is about to shoot everyone, but Don comes out of his camper and subdues him. Chacon then comes around the corner with Melissa held at gunpoint and again is about to kill them all, but is momentarily distracted by the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/4th_of_July"" title=""4th of July"">4th of July</a> fireworks.

They wade out into the Pacific in their Jaeger, Gipsy Danger, with orders to kill the Kaiju and save the city. They are told to ignore the small fishing boat, Saltchuck that is in the middle of the battle. Raleigh ignores the command, and attempts to save the ship. He and Yancy believe they are victorious after shooting Knifehead with the plasma cannon built into the right arm, and prepare to leave. Knifehead reappears and attacks as the Jaeger is turned, ripping off Gipsy Danger's left arm, and causing Raleigh permanent damage. Knifehead then attacks the head, ripping it open and killing Yancy. Raleigh pilots the Jaeger solo, killing Knifehead, but receiving severe damage to Gipsy Danger in the process. He limped the Jaeger ashore on the Alaskan coast, much to the amazement of a father and son who witness the event. Raliegh emerges from the broken hull of Gipsy Danger dazed and bloodied before falling to the ground unconscious while the father sends his son off to get medical help. Traumatized by the sudden loss of his brother while still mentally connected to him, Raleigh quits the Jaeger Program.</p>"", u'<p>In 2025, the participating governments deem the Jaeger program unsustainable and discontinue and decommission it in favor of building defensive coastal walls, collectively called the Kaiju Wall. The four remaining Jaegers are redeployed to <a href=""/wiki/Hong_Kong"" title=""Hong Kong"">Hong Kong</a> to protect the coast until the walls are completed. Jaeger commander Marshall Stacker Pentecost resolves to make a last-ditch attempt to end the Kaiju threat by destroying The Breach with a <a href=""/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"" title=""Nuclear weapon"">nuclear weapon</a>, even though past nuclear strikes on the portal have been unsuccessful. Stacker plans to follow through with the initial Jaeger objective, regardless of the lack of funding. He flies to the Kaiju Wall, where Raleigh has been working for the past five years. Raleigh and the other workers are watching the news, which shows the Wall failing and a Kaiju named Mutavore attacking Sydney, Australia, before it\'s stopped by the Jaeger Striker Eureka, piloted by Herc and Chuck Hansen. Chuck asserts that the reason the Jaeger program failed was because of weak pilots. Stacker asks Raleigh to re-join the program, but he declines. He and his brother were still connected when he died and he cannot stand the mental pain another time. Stacker asks where he would rather die: building the Wall, ""or in a Jaeger,"" fighting Kaiju. Raliegh reluctantly returns to the Jaeger Program.</p>', u""<p>Raleigh travels to Hong Kong with Pentecost and begins the process of finding a new co-pilot.When they arrive in Hong Kong, they are greeted by Mako Mori, later revealed as Pentecost's adopted daughter and director of the Jaeger refurbishment project. She shows Raleigh around the Shatterdome. They get into an elevator with two scientists, Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb, who comprise the entire research team for the base. The Jaegers stationed in the Shatterdome are all the remaining mechs; Crimson Typhoon, which features three arms and is piloted by the Wei triplets. The second is called Cherno Alpha, piloted by a pair of Russians, Sasha and Aleksis Kaidonovsky. Herc and Chuck Hansen pilot the only Mark-5, Striker Eureka. Mako then shows Raleigh to Gipsy Danger, who has been rebuilt with additional weapons for the final mission.

Pentecost deems her unfit for combat and grounds both her and Raleigh. She tells him that he will meet with the candidates for his partnership soon, and that she hopes to be a pilot one day. Her record is impressive, but she makes it clear that Stacker will not allow her to fight. She then goes to her room, but watches him from the door as he changes. In the mess hall, Raleigh is invited by Herc to sit with him and Chuck, but Chuck takes an instant dislike to Raleigh because he believes him to be weak, and fears that he will endanger their mission. Herc apologizes for his behavior, making it known that his son is a hothead and very impulsive. Stacker then goes to meet with the scientists. Gottleib tells him that, based on the data, they can expect a Double Event soon, and a triple soon afterward. Newton asserts that he believes he can connect with the Kaiju via Drift, the same as pilots in the Jaeger program do.

Stacker tells Mako that she is too inexperienced, and won't be piloting again, and Mako leaves. Raleigh strikes out at Stacker, saying that he knows why he won't let Mako fight, since he's been in her memories.

The Kaiju swiftly destroy Crimson Typhoon, prompting Herc and Chuck to assist. Striker Eureka arrives and joins the battle against Leatherback and Otachi, but not before the creatures overpower Cherno Alpha. Otachi then moved to attack Hong Kong. Leatherback triggers an EMP, disabling both Striker Eureka and the command center. Tendo says it will take two hours to get it all back online, so Stacker deploys Mako and Raleigh, as Gipsy Danger's nuclear core was unaffected by the EMP.

Stacker instructs Newton to do another link, with a fresh brain, which he can get from the black market dealer Hannibal Chau. Seeking more information, Pentecost orders Geiszler to repeat the experiment on an intact Kaiju brain and sends him to Hannibal Chau, a criminal who sells Kaiju body parts on the black market. When he finds him, he is astounded to see that Chau has equipment and specimens that even the government doesn\'t have. Newton tells Chau that he wants to establish another link, and Chau tells him that it\'s dangerous because now the Kaiju know where Newton is and will want to kill him.

Geiszler warns the two Jaegers that they must take a Kaiju into the Breach with them for the attack to succeed.Stacker and Chuck decide to deploy the bomb, sacrificing Striker and themselves to try and kill Scunner and Slattern to give Mako and Raleigh a chance to get through the portal. Pentecost and Chuck Hansen detonate the bomb in order to clear a path to the portal for Raleigh and Mako. Since <i>Gipsy Danger</i> is powered by a <a href=""/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_core"" title=""Nuclear reactor core"">nuclear reactor core</a>, it can be used as an improvised bomb to destroy The Breach.

The Gipsy Danger crew are losing oxygen rapidly, so Raleigh gives Mako his share, and deploys her ejection pod. He then proceeds to manually overload the nuclear reactor just as Gipsy enters the Anteverse. Raleigh ejects himself out and back to Earth seconds before Gipsy Danger is set to self-destruct and detonates, on the other side of the portal, decimating the alien forces, their base and sealing off the Breach.

Reg, Wilf and Cissy were in the cast of a very highly rated recording of the opera <i><a href=""/wiki/Rigoletto"" title=""Rigoletto"">Rigoletto</a></i>, which includes a famous quartet for soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor and baritone (""<a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Bella_figlia_dell%27amore"" title=""Bella figlia dell\'amore"">Bella figlia dell\'amore</a>""). This version is very prominent among opera buffs as THE <i>Rigoletto</i> of the post-war era.</p>', u'<p>One day, Reg is shocked to find his former wife Jean Horton, the missing soprano of the <i>Rigoletto</i> recording, turning up to live at Beecham House. Reg is angry not to have been warned as their parting was on very sour terms.</p>', u'<p>At first Jean tries unsuccessfully to mend things with Reg. In the ensuing conversations her infidelity arises, as well as her past marriages, but Reg comes to understand that all that is past. In the meantime, Wilf and Cissy convince Cedric that bringing together those who sang the quartet on the famous recording to sing it again for the Verdi Gala concert will sell enough tickets to save the home. Enchanted with the idea, they persuade Reg to overcome his objections to performing with Jean again. However, she is harder to persuade as she vowed never to sing again after retiring.</p>', u'<p>Cissy takes Jean flowers from the garden to cheer her up and asks if she wishes to discuss the quartet, but Jean becomes violent and attacks Cissy, which only aggravates Cissy\'s already delicate senile condition. Jean apologises and is finally persuaded to sing in the quartet from <i>Rigoletto</i>, after learning that Anne Langley will be singing ""<a href=""/wiki/Vissi_d%27arte"" title=""Vissi d\'arte"">Vissi d\'arte</a>"" from <i><a href=""/wiki/Tosca"" title=""Tosca"">Tosca</a></i>. The group prepares for their performance and, moments before their curtain call, Cissy gets very confused and attempts to walk out the door, saying that she has to go back to her family, but Jean manages to salvage the situation. During her conversation with Cissy, Jean expresses regret for all her past bad behaviour towards Reg and admits that she is still in love with him. Reg overhears this.</p>', u'<p>Just as the recital is about to start, the director of the home is amazed at the energy displayed by the guests of the home. The idea of rehearsing and playing before an audience brings life back to them, leading her to the conclusion that old age and art go together.

At the age of 21, Tim is told by his father that the men of his family have a special gift: the ability to travel in time. This supernatural ability is subject to one constraint - they can only travel to places and times they have been before. After his father discourages Tim from using his gift to acquire money or fame, he decides that he will use it to improve his love life.</p>', u'<p>The following summer, Kit Kat\'s friend Charlotte (<a href=""/wiki/Margot_Robbie"" title=""Margot Robbie"">Margot Robbie</a>) comes to the house in order to spend her holiday with Tim\'s family. Tim is instantly attracted to her and at the end of her stay decides to tell her how he feels. She tells him that he should not have waited until the last day, that perhaps if he had told her earlier, something could have happened between them. Tim travels back in time and, the second time around, tells Charlotte in the middle of the holiday how he feels. In this instance, Charlotte uses the exact opposite excuse, saying that it would be better if they waited until the last day of the holiday, and then something could potentially happen between them. Heartbroken, Tim realizes that Charlotte is not attracted to him and that time travel will not make it possible for him to change her mind.</p>', u'<p>After the summer, Tim moves to London to pursue a career as a barrister. He is put up by his father\'s old acquaintance, Harry (<a href=""/wiki/Tom_Hollander"" title=""Tom Hollander"">Tom Hollander</a>), a misanthropic playwright.

Tim goes back in time to put things right and the play is a triumph.</p>', u'<p>Having saved Harry\'s opening night, Tim tries to call Mary, but discovers that her number is no longer in his mobile phone.

He encounters Charlotte again by accident, and this time she tells him that she would be interested in pursuing a romantic liaison with him. Tim turns her down, realising that he is truly in love with Mary. He proposes marriage; she accepts and is welcomed into his family. Their first child, Posy, is born.

When he returns to the present time, he finds Posy has never been born and that he has a son instead. His father explains that travelling back to change things before his children were born would mean those children would not be born. Thus, any events that occurred before Posy\'s birth cannot be changed, and Tim must accept the consequences as a normal person would. Tim accepts he cannot change Kit\'s life by changing her past but he and Mary help her to change her life in the present. She settles down with an old friend of Tim\'s and has a child of her own. Tim and Mary have another child, a boy named Jeff.</p>', u'<p>Tim learns that his father has terminal cancer and that time travel cannot change it. His father has known for quite some time, but kept travelling back in time to effectively extend his life and spend more time with his family. He tells Tim to live each day twice in order to be truly happy: the first time, live it as normal, and the second time, live every day again almost exactly the same. The first time with all the tensions and worries that stop us noticing how sweet the world can be, but the second time noticing. Tim follows this advice and also travels back into the past to visit his father whenever he misses him.</p>', u'<p>Mary tells Tim she wants a third child. He is reluctant at first because he will not be able to visit his father after the baby is born but agrees. After visiting his father for the following nine months, Tim tells his father that he cannot visit any more.

A young Annabeth, Luke, Grover and Thalia are running to Camp Half-Blood while being pursued by monsters. Thalia sacrifices herself to get the others into the camp, and her father Zeus transforms her into a pine tree, creating a magical border around the camp. Soon a Cyclops passes through the border and is revealed to be Tyson, Percy\'s half-brother. The camp is later attacked by a <a href=""/wiki/Khalkotauroi"" title=""Khalkotauroi"">Colchis Bull</a> who breaks through the border and ravages Camp Half-Blood. Percy defeats it with the help of Tyson, Annabeth, and Clarisse. Following this, Luke (who had survived his and Percy\'s battle in the previous film) appears and confronts Percy, trying to convert him to his cause. When Percy refuses, Luke disappears.</p>', u'<p>The campers realize that Thalia\'s tree has been poisoned by Luke and they are vulnerable to attacks. Percy visits the Oracle, who tells him of a prophecy of a half-blood of the eldest gods either saving or destroying Olympus. Chiron tells Percy that he is the only living half-blood of the eldest gods, so the half-blood in the Prophecy may refer to him. Annabeth and Grover learn about the <a href=""/wiki/Golden_Fleece"" title=""Golden Fleece"">Golden Fleece</a>, which has the power to heal anything, and propose a quest in which they retrieve the Fleece and use it to heal Thalia\'s tree. Mr. D chooses Clarisse to lead the quest, much to Annabeth\'s and Percy\'s dismay. Percy convinces Grover and Annabeth to accompany him on the quest, and Tyson joins them. Annabeth hails the Chariot of Damnation, and Percy threatens the three drivers (<a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/The_Graeae"" title=""The Graeae"">the Graeae</a>) to tell him of his prophecy, causing them to give him coordinates in the Sea of Monsters before ejecting the group from the cab in Washington D.C.

Percy finds Grover, and the five escape Polyphemus, retrieving the fleece and trapping him in his cave. Afterwards, Luke arrives and demands the fleece from Percy, who refuses. Luke shoots a crossbow bolt at Percy, but Tyson takes the bolt in the chest and falls into the water below.</p>', u'<p>Luke begins reviving Kronos, and Annabeth encourages Percy to take leadership. The team escapes captivity, and Percy grapples with Luke over the Fleece, but Luke easily gains the upper hand. Luke is suddenly thrown away by Tyson, revealed to have survived his wound due to the water healing it, as he is Poseidon\'s son. Kronos rises from the sarcophagus and consumes Luke and Grover before battling Percy. Percy realizes that Riptide is the ""cursed blade"" of the prophecy and slices Kronos into pieces imprisoning Kronos in the sarcophagus once again, causing him to regurgitate Grover and Luke, the latter landing in Polyphemus\'s Lair. Their victory is short lived as Annabeth is stabbed by the Manticore, who is killed in turn by Clarisse and Grover. Annabeth dies in Percy\'s arms but is resurrected by the Fleece. Percy then gives the fleece to Clarisse, and they return to Camp Half-Blood. Clarisse places the fleece on Thalia\'s tree. The group returns the next day to find Thalia alive, as the fleece returned her to human form.</p>', u""<p>Percy realizes that Thalia is a child of Zeus and is another possible child of the prophecy about either preserving or destroying Olympus.

Ashburn and Mullins discover a surveillance video in the DEA agents\' van showing Mullins\' brother, Jason (<a href=""/wiki/Michael_Rapaport"" title=""Michael Rapaport"">Michael Rapaport</a>), apparently connected to Larkin\'s organization. Jason was recently released from prison, having been put there by Mullins to keep him off the streets and out of trouble.</p>', u'<p>Ashburn convinces Mullins to go to her parents\' home to ask Jason for information on Larkin. On their arrival at the home, it becomes apparent that Mullins\' parents (particularly her mother) and three other brothers (two of whom have girlfriends) still resent Mullins for her involvement in Jason\'s incarceration. Jason, however, does not have any ill feelings toward his sister, and tips her off about the body of a murdered drug dealer by the name of Sal Netalie in an abandoned car. Chemicals on the victim\'s shoes lead Ashburn and Mullins to an abandoned paint factory, where they witness a drug dealer being murdered by Julian Vincent, vicious criminal and second-in-command of Larkin\'s organization. They apprehend Julian but are unable to extract any substantial information regarding Larkin\'s whereabouts, even with Mullins going so far as to play <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Russian_Roulette"" title=""Russian Roulette"">Russian Roulette</a> with Julian\'s testicles.</p>', u'<p>The pair spend the evening bonding in a bar, where a drunk Ashburn reveals that her <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Foster_child"" title=""Foster child"">foster child</a> past may be partly to blame for her attitude. After a night of raucous drinking and partying, Ashburn wakes up the following morning to discover that, in her drunkenness, she has given her car keys to Wayne, one of the bar patrons.

Julian is about to torture them with knives when he gets called away by Larkin. Before Julian leaves, he stabs Ashburn in the leg and leaves the knife in the wound.

Craig begins to untie the two women, but is shot and killed by Adam. Ashburn and Mullins learn that Adam is actually Larkin, who has been working his own case from inside the DEA for several months. Julian returns and Larkin orders him to kill Ashburn and Mullins while he goes to the hospital to kill Jason.

Mullins and Ashburn race to the hospital to save Jason.</p>', u'<p>Upon their arrival, Mullins rushes to find Jason. Ashburn, hindered by the stab wound in her leg, lags behind, unable to move quickly. Mullins learns that, due to the foul language she and her family exhibit, the doctor moved Jason to another room in the hospital; she finds Jason\'s room, only to be disarmed by Larkin. He is about to kill Jason when Ashburn, having had to crawl to the room, subdues Larkin by shooting him in the genitals (much to Mullins\' surprise, as she would never actually done so; scaring Julian earlier was only a way of making him talk). With Larkin captured, Ashburn requests to stay in the FBI\'s Boston field office, having developed a strong friendship with Mullins. Jason is shown having fully recovered from his coma. The film ends with Mullins receiving a commendation from the Boston Police Department. Members of her family are present and they cheer Mullins, now having reconciled with her.

He confronts K, who is with his partner <a href=""/wiki/Agent_J"" title=""Agent J"">Agent J</a>, telling him he is ""already dead"". J then discovers that K was responsible not only for capturing Boris, but for deploying the ""ArcNet"", a shield that prevented the Boglodites from conquering Earth and caused their extinction.</p>', u'<p>Boris travels back in time to kill the young Agent K. With history altered so that K is long-dead, J finds that only his memory has been unaffected, and no one from the Agency understands his obsession with K until Agent O, the new Chief, deduces that there has been a fracture in the space-time continuum. With K out of the picture, the ArcNet was never deployed, and there is nothing to protect the present-day Earth from the Boglodite invasion, so J must travel back in time to stop Boris and save K. Back in 1969, he travels to Coney Island, knowing from the Agency\'s records that, in 1969, Boris will commit a murder there. He finds Boris, but is discovered and arrested by 1969 K, who prepares to wipe his memory, but decides at the last minute to investigate J\'s claims. K and J follow clues, leading them to a bowling alley, and then to <a href=""/wiki/The_Factory"" title=""The Factory"">The Factory</a>, where they come across an alien named Griffin, who is in possession of the ArcNet. Griffin, who can see all possible future timelines and outcomes, senses Boris is coming and escapes, but he later captures him. J and K pursue and rescue Griffin, acquiring the ArcNet. 1969 Boris escapes and 2012 Boris arrives and they team up.</p>', u'<p>J, K, and Griffin fly to <a href=""/wiki/Cape_Canaveral"" title=""Cape Canaveral"">Cape Canaveral</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Florida"" title=""Florida"">Florida</a>, where the ArcNet must be attached to the <a href=""/wiki/Apollo_11"" title=""Apollo 11"">Apollo 11</a> rocket so it can be deployed in space. They are stopped by military police, but Griffin shows a skeptical colonel the future, convincing him of the importance of their mission, and the colonel assists them in reaching the launch site. As the agents climb up the rocket\'s launch tower, both 1969 Boris and 2012 Boris attack them. Using his time-travel device, J evades an attack by 2012 Boris and knocks him off one of the launch tower bridges. K shoots off 1969 Boris\'s left arm (which restores the timeline), knocking him off the tower as well. The ArcNet is attached and deploys successfully when the rocket launches, with 2012 Boris being incinerated by the rocket\'s exhaust. 1969 Boris then attacks K on the beach, but the colonel pushes K down and out of the way, taking the hit himself instead. K then kills Boris (which 2012 K had regretted not doing) instead of arresting him as he originally did. The colonel\'s young son inquires about his father, but rather than tell him the truth, K wipes his memory and tells him only that his father is a hero. Observing from afar, J realizes that the young boy is himself, the colonel was his father, and that K has actually been watching over him all his life. J returns to 2012 with the timeline restored, reunites with K, and subtly thanks him for everything he has done.</p>']"

No other bid is placed, and the grandfather takes ownership of Joey, planning to return with him to his farm. He tells Albert that Emilie has died, and after hearing about the miracle horse, he travelled for three days to get Joey back, for the sake of his beloved granddaughter's memory.</p>"", u""<p>Albert pleads for the horse with Emilie's grandfather, who at first remains stoic.

2012,UK,Dr. Seuss' The Lorax,boxofficemojo,United States,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lorax_(film),"[u'<p>Ted Wiggins is an idealistic 12-year-old boy, who lives in ""Thneedville"", a walled city that, aside from the human citizens, is completely artificial; everything is made of plastic, metal, or synthetics with no living plants. Ted has a crush on local environmentalist Audrey, who wants to see a ""real tree"" more than anything in the world, and decides to find one in order to impress her. His energetic Grammy Norma secretly tells Ted the legend of the Once-ler, who will tell anyone about trees if you brought him fifteen cents, a nail, and a shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail. When Ted leaves Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, he discovers that the outside world is a contaminated, empty wasteland. Once the boy finds him, the Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees on the condition that he listens to the story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, but on his way home, he encounters the mayor of Thneedville, Aloysius O\'Hare, who is also the proprietor of a company that sells bottled oxygen to Thneedville residents. O\'Hare explains to Ted that because trees produce oxygen free of charge, he considers it a threat to his business whenever he hears people talking about them. After revealing that he has ""security camera eyes"" all over the city, O\'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town. However, Ted continues to sneak out of O\'Hare\'s sight (with his grandmother\'s encouragement) and learns more of the trees\' history.</p>', u'<p>Over Ted\'s various visits, the Once-ler recounts the story of how he departed his family to make his fortune. After stumbling upon a lush Truffula Tree forest, the Once-ler meets the guardian of the forest, the Lorax, after cutting down a Truffula Tree. The Lorax urges Once-ler to leave the forest, but Once-ler refuses. Eventually, the Once-ler promises not to chop another tree down, and the two seem to begin a friendship of sorts. Then, the young businessman\'s Thneed invention becomes a major success and Once-ler\'s family arrives to participate in the business. At first keeping his promise, the Once-ler continues Thneed production by harvesting the Truffula Tree tufts in a slow, but sustainable manner. However, soon his greedy and lazy relatives convince him to resume chopping down the trees. Over time, the Once-ler\'s deforestation spirals into a mass overproduction. Flushed with wealth, the Once-ler rationalizes his short-sighted needs into arrogant self-righteousness, and the Lorax\'s helpless protests do not stop him. The Once-ler pollutes the sky, river, and landscape, until the very last Truffula Tree falls. With no further chance of business, he is left broken and abandoned by his family, with his mother disowning him, and with the region uninhabitable because of his business\'s pollution, the Lorax sends the animals off to find a new place to live before he departs into the sky, leaving only a stone-cut word: ""Unless"". Distraught and ruined, the Once-ler became a recluse.</p>', u""<p>After he finishes telling his story, the Once-ler finally understands the meaning behind the Lorax's last message, and gives Ted the last Truffula seed in hopes that he can plant it and make others care about real trees once more. Ted's desire to impress Audrey is now a personal mission to remind his town of the importance of nature. O'Hare, still determined not to have trees undermine his business, takes heavy-handed steps such as covering Audrey's nature paintings, closing off the door that Ted uses to see the Once-ler, and forcibly searching Ted's room for the seed. Ted enlists his family and Audrey to help plant the seed, which has begun to germinate after coming into contact with water. O'Hare and his employees pursue the dissidents until they manage to elude him and reach the town center. When Ted finally attempts to plant the seed, he is interrupted by O'Hare, who rallies the population to stop them by telling the people that trees are dangerous and filthy. To convince them otherwise, Ted takes an earthmover and rams down a section of the city wall to reveal the environmental destruction outside, thereby showing them what O'Hare is encouraging. Horrified at the sight and inspired by Ted's conviction, the crowd defies O'Hare, with his own henchmen expelling him from the town. The seed is finally planted, and Audrey kisses Ted on the cheek. Time passes and the land starts to recover; new trees sprout, the animals begin to return, and the redeemed Once-ler is happily reunited with the Lorax.</p>""]"

Only Ellison is aware that the house they are moving into was the crime scene from the opening scene.

Ellison discovers that the films are actually <a href=""/wiki/Snuff_film"" title=""Snuff film"">snuff films</a> depicting different families being murdered in various ways: being tied to sunbeds and drowned in their pool (<i>Pool Party \'66</i>), being bound and gagged and burned to death in a car (<i>BBQ \'79</i>), being run over by a lawn mower (<i>Lawn Work \'86</i>), being bound and gagged and having their throats slit in bed (<i>Sleepy Time \'98</i>), and the hanging from the opening of the film (<i>Family Hanging Out \'11</i>). The drowning film is especially disturbing for Ellison when he notices the face of a <a href=""/wiki/Demon"" title=""Demon"">demonic</a> figure watching the drownings from the bottom of the pool. Ellison eventually finds the demonic figure throughout all the films along with a strange painted symbol. Upon inspecting the lid of the box containing the films, and a snake, Ellison discovers childish drawings depicting the murders, along with crude sketches of the demonic figure, called ""Mr. Boogie.""</p>', u'<p>Consulting a local deputy (<a href=""/wiki/James_Ransone"" title=""James Ransone"">James Ransone</a>), Ellison discovers that the murders depicted in the films took place at different times, beginning in the 1960s, and in different cities across the country. He also learns that some of the families were drugged before being killed, and that a child from each family went missing following every murder. The deputy refers Ellison to a local professor, Jonas (<a href=""/wiki/Vincent_D%27Onofrio"" title=""Vincent D\'Onofrio"">Vincent D\'Onofrio</a>), whose expertise is the <a href=""/wiki/Occult"" title=""Occult"">occult</a> and demonic phenomena, to decipher the symbol in the films.

Ellison returns outside to retrieve his bat when he encounters a black <a href=""/wiki/Rottweiler"" title=""Rottweiler"">rottweiler</a>. The dog sees the missing children standing behind Ellison, causing the dog to flee out of fear. The second night, Ellison hears a noise within the home and investigates, again armed with his bat, being plagued by the missing children in various states of decay. After Ellison checks in on Ashley and leaves, Stephanie is shown in front of Ashley, painting her family\'s murder with Bughuul. The third night, Ellison hears the film projector running and goes up to the attic. There, he finds the missing children watching one of the films. Bughuul suddenly appears on camera before physically appearing before Ellison. Ellison takes the camera and the films to the backyard and burns them. His recently awakened wife meets him outside and he tells her that they\'re moving back to their old house immediately.</p>', u'<p>At his old home, Ellison receives a message from Professor Jonas, who sends him scans of historical <a href=""/wiki/Religious_images_in_Christian_theology"" title=""Religious images in Christian theology"">images</a> associated with Bughuul; the images have been partially destroyed by the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Early_Christians"" title=""Early Christians"">early Christians</a>, who believed that images of Bughuul served as a gateway for the demon to come from the spiritual realm to the mortal world; the images include the symbol from the murders along with a scorpion, a snake, and a black beast. According to Professor Jonas, people, especially children, who saw the images of Bughuul could be possessed and even abducted into the images. Ellison discovers the projector and films in his attic, along with a new envelope of film labeled ""<i>extended cut endings</i>"". During this time, the deputy tries calling several times, but Ellison never answers. The next time the deputy calls, while Ellison is assembling the films, he finally answers. The deputy informs him that he has discovered a link between the murders: every family had previously lived in the house where the last murder took place, and each new murder occurred shortly after the family moved from the crime scene into their new residence. By moving, Ellison has placed himself and his family in line to be the next victims.</p>', u'<p>Ellison watches the footage, and finds that it depicts the missing children coming onscreen following each murder, revealing themselves to be the killers, apparently under Bughuul\'s possession before suddenly disappearing. Before he can react, Ellison becomes light-headed, and upon inspection of his coffee cup, he notices a bright green liquid mixed with the coffee and finds a note reading ""Good Night, Daddy"" before losing consciousness. Ashley appears behind Ellison, revealing herself to be the drugger, under Bughuul\'s possession. Ellison awakens to find himself, Tracy and Trevor bound and gagged. Ashley approaches holding the 8\xa0mm camera, and promises him that she will make him famous again. Ashley then decapitates Tracy with an axe before going on to kill Elison and Trevor, using their blood to paint images of cats, dogs and unicorns on the walls. With her work complete, Ashley views the Super-8 film of her murders, which concludes with an image of the missing children watching her. Bughuul appears, causing the children to flee in fear. He then lifts Ashley into his arms and disappears into the film with her.</p>', u'<p>The film concludes with an image of the box of films in the Oswalt family\'s attic, now accompanied by Ashley\'s reel, labeled ""<i>House Painting \'12</i>"". The camera slowly pans away from the box, until Bughuul appears onscreen and the screen cuts out.</p>']"

They are publicly humiliated, losing any chance of winning. Four months later, newly arrived Barden freshman Beca Mitchell (<a href=""/wiki/Anna_Kendrick"" title=""Anna Kendrick"">Anna Kendrick</a>) has no desire to attend college, but she is forced to do so by her father (<a href=""/wiki/John_Benjamin_Hickey"" title=""John Benjamin Hickey"">John Benjamin Hickey</a>), a professor at the university, with whom Beca has a strained relationship.

After some persuasion from Chloe Beale (<a href=""/wiki/Brittany_Snow"" title=""Brittany Snow"">Brittany Snow</a>) the co-leader of the Bellas along with Aubrey, she reluctantly joins the Barden Bellas. Aubrey does not initially approve of recruiting Beca, but yields nonetheless due to a desperate need for members and Beca\'s talent.

In spite of their old set list, the group manages to place second, which sends them to the semi-finals. A short scuffle after the competition leads to Beca accidentally smashing a window with the trophy which alerts a police officer standing outside who then arrests her. Jesse tries to help by calling Beca's father, who then tells Beca that he will no longer pay for her to move to Los Angeles because of the incident. This infuriates Beca, which turns her budding friendship with Jesse sour. In the meantime, Beca suggests to the Bellas to try to be more daring, but Aubrey insists that they will win with the repertoire the group has always used in the past.</p>"", u'<p>At the semi-finals, Beca provides an impromptu back-up of one of her favorite songs into the ""traditional"" song on the Bellas\' set list to reinvigorate the crowd after they seemed to have lost interest. The Bellas come in third in the competition behind the Treblemakers and the Footnotes. Even though the audience seemed to enjoy Beca\'s remix, Aubrey becomes furious with Beca, who in turn quits. When the Footnotes are later disqualified from the national competition because the lead singer was in high school, the Bellas are called to take part instead. The Bellas re-form after spring break, with the notable exception of Beca. During rehearsals, Chloe stands up against Aubrey\'s stubbornness. The group starts to fall apart, which sparks a fight. Meanwhile, Beca tries to apologize to Jesse, which he declines. Beca then apologizes to the Bellas for her actions during the semi-finals and asks to have another chance, which Aubrey eventually allows. After having a group heart-to-heart conversation, the Bellas decide to adopt Beca\'s more modern and original music style. Meanwhile, group leader Bumper (<a href=""/wiki/Adam_DeVine"" title=""Adam DeVine"">Adam DeVine</a>) leaves the Treblemakers after being offered a job as a back-up singer for <a href=""/wiki/John_Mayer"" title=""John Mayer"">John Mayer</a>.

The current Santa: Malcolm and the Christmas elves deliver presents to every child in the world using advanced equipment and military precision.

During a delivery operation, when a child wakes up and almost sees Malcolm, a Christmas elf back in the S-1 inadvertently presses a button, causing a present to fall off a conveyor and go unnoticed.</p>', u""<p>Having completed his 70th mission, Malcolm is portrayed as far past his prime and whose role in field operations now is largely symbolic. Nonetheless, he is held in high esteem, and delivers a congratulatory speech to the enraptured elves. Much to Steve's frustration, who has long anticipated succeeding his father, Malcolm announces he looks forward to his 71st. During their family Christmas dinner, Arthur's suggestion for the family to play a board game degenerates into a petty quarrel between Malcolm and Steve, while Malcolm's father and predecessor Grandsanta, bored by retirement, resentfully criticizes their over-modernization. Distraught, the various family members leave the dinner table. When Arthur humbly compliments Steve that he believes he will be a great Santa Claus, Steve rudely dismisses Arthur's overture. Later, their father shares with his wife Margaret his grave doubts about his self-identity should he retire.</p>"", u'<p>Meanwhile, a Christmas elf named Bryony finds the missed present\u2014a wrapped bicycle that has yet to be delivered\u2014and alerts Steve and Peter to the problem. Arthur is alarmed when he recognizes the present as a gift for Gwen, a little girl whose letter he had personally replied to. Arthur alerts his father, who is at a loss as to how to handle the situation; Steve argues that one missed present out of billions is an acceptable error whose correction can wait a few days. Grandsanta on the other hand, apparently learning of the dire situation, proposes delivering the gift using Eve (mispronounced as ""evie""), his old wooden sleigh, and the great-great-grandchildren of the original eight <a href=""/wiki/Reindeer"" title=""Reindeer"">reindeer</a>, forcefully whisking away a reluctant Arthur and a stowaway Bryony. They get lost in three different continents, lose several of their reindeer, and land in danger several times, ultimately being mistaken for aliens and causing an international military incident. Through all this, Arthur eventually learns, to his compounding disappointment, that Grandsanta\'s true motive is to fulfill his ego, that Steve refuses to help them out of petty resentment and possibility of his brother being made hero overshadowing his work, and that his own father has gone to bed, apparently content even though a present was not delivered.</p>', u""<p>Finally, stranded in Cuba after losing the sleigh and the remaining reindeer, Arthur renews his sense of purpose\u2014that it all comes down to having presents delivered, regardless of how it is done and who did it\u2014and with Grandsanta's and Bryony's help manages to recover the sleigh. Meanwhile, the elves grow increasingly alarmed at rumors of this neglected delivery and the Clauses' unthinkable indifference, sending them into a panic. In response, Malcolm, Margaret, and Steve take the high-tech sleigh-craft to deliver a superior present\u2014to the wrong child.</p>"", u""<p>In the meantime, Arthur and his party lose the remaining reindeer and a US Predator drone scrambled by Chief De Silva of UNFITA intercepts and opens fire on them thinking that they were aliens, causing Arthur to bail out of the sleigh, via parachute. Ultimately with Margaret and Bryony's help, all the male Clauses arrive at Gwen's house before she awakens, only to have all but Arthur quarrel about who gets to actually place the gift. Noticing that only Arthur truly cares about the girl's feelings, the elder Clauses collectively realize that he is the sole worthy successor. As a result, Malcolm gives Arthur the honor and Steve, upon learning of his own errors and acknowledges that his brother is the worthy Santa instead of him, forfeits his supposed birthright to his brother. In a fitting conclusion, Gwen glimpses a snow-bearded Arthur in a wind-buffeted sweater just before vanishing up into the S-1.</p>"", u'<p>With the crisis resolved, Malcolm goes into a happy retirement with Margaret; he also becomes Grand-Santa\'s much-desired new companion and plays Arthur\'s board game with him for many happy hours.

Thomas wants the same ballerina to portray the innocent, fragile White Swan as well as her dark, sensual twin, the Black Swan. Nina auditions for the part, performing flawlessly as the White Swan, but not quite able to emulate the characteristics of the Black Swan. Although Nina does not do well during her audition, she approaches Thomas and asks him to reconsider her as the lead role. He tells her she is the ideal dancer to cast as the White Swan, but she lacks the passion needed to correctly portray the Black Swan.</p>', u'<p>Nina at first reluctantly accepts this and decides to leave when Thomas stops her and chides her for giving up too easily. Though he praises her technique, he criticizes her machine-like performance, saying that he has never once seen her lose herself. Nina says that she wants to be perfect, to which Thomas retorts by saying that perfection isn\'t about control, it\'s about \'letting go.\' When Thomas forcibly kisses Nina, she displays a change of character and bites him, convincing him to cast her as the Swan Queen. An intoxicated Beth angrily confronts Thomas and Nina. She is later hit by a car and seriously injured in what Thomas suspects was a suicide attempt. Nina begins to witness strange happenings. Thomas, meanwhile, becomes increasingly critical of her ""frigid"" dancing and advises her to stop being a perfectionist and to lose herself in the role. Thomas points to Lily (<a href=""/wiki/Mila_Kunis"" title=""Mila Kunis"">Mila Kunis</a>), another dancer in the company, whom he describes as lacking Nina\'s flawless technique but possessing an uninhibited quality that Nina has not shown.

The next morning, Nina wakes up alone and late for rehearsal. When she arrives at the studio, she finds Lily dancing as the Swan Queen. Furious, she confronts Lily and asks her why she did not wake her up that morning. After Lily admits she spent the night with a man whom she met at the club, Nina realizes she dreamed the encounter. Nina\'s hallucinations become stronger as she sees Thomas and Lily have sex in a backstage area and Beth stabbing herself in the face at the hospital with a nail file which Nina drops bloodied in the elevator.</p>', u""<p>Nina later has a violent argument with her mother, after which she passes out.

Back in her dressing room before the final act, Nina is congratulated by Lily, revealing that their fight was, again, imaginary. The mirror, however, is still shattered. Nina removes a small shard from her own body and realizes she had stabbed herself.

While performing a scene in which they dance together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry, despite her being merely an extra. With a little guidance from Valentin (he draws a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Beauty_spot"" title=""Beauty spot"">beauty spot</a> on her, which will eventually be her trademark, after finding her in his dressing room), Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles.</p>', u'<p>Two years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad.

Peppy visits the hospital and discovers that the film he rescued is the one with them dancing together. She asks for him to be moved to her house to recuperate. Valentin awakens in a bed at her house, to find that Clifton is now working for Peppy. Valentin seems to remain dismissive of Peppy having taken him in, prompting Clifton to sternly remind Valentin of his changing luck.</p>', u'<p>Peppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in her next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if Zimmer does not agree to her terms.

Peppy arrives, panicked, and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide with a handgun. Peppy tells him she only wanted to help him. They embrace and Valentin tells her it\'s no use; no one wants to hear him speak.

The film chronologically reconnects Dexter, Emma or both of them on that one day over the next 18 years after they go their separate ways.</p>', u'<p>One year later in 1989, Dexter helps Emma move into a flat in London where she plans to pursue a career as a writer. However, after little success, she ends up working as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant by 1990, and meets Ian (<a href=""/wiki/Rafe_Spall"" title=""Rafe Spall"">Rafe Spall</a>), an aspiring comedian who is hired soon after. Dexter is travelling the world while drinking and having sex promiscuously with a succession of girlfriends, but they keep in contact via phonecalls and letters. He then visits Emma on 15 July 1991 and, to get her out of her rut, suggests they go away for the weekend. They flirt back and forth and it\'s made clear that Emma may have deeper feelings for him, but since she knows that Dexter is not boyfriend material, nothing comes of it and two more years fly by.

Also, his mother appears very unimpressed with the nature of his television show and reveals that she no longer believes he is a nice man. On the same day, Emma goes out on a date with Ian. Although there appears to be no romantic spark between them, she knows he means well and so they continue to date anyway.</p>', u'<p>By 1995, Emma is now a school teacher and has moved in with Ian. However, she grows more and more irritated with him because of his lack of ambition and failure to contribute to maintaining their household.

On 15 July 2000, Emma\'s former university roommate and Dexter\'s old best friend get married, and both Emma and Dexter are invited to the wedding.

Managed by his mother, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo), and trained by his older half-brother, <a href=""/wiki/Dicky_Eklund"" title=""Dicky Eklund"">Dicky Eklund</a> (Christian Bale), Micky has not had a particularly successful career: He\'s become a ""stepping stone"" for other boxers to defeat on their way up. Complicating matters, Dicky, a former boxer whose peak of success was going the distance with <a href=""/wiki/Sugar_Ray_Leonard"" title=""Sugar Ray Leonard"">Sugar Ray Leonard</a> in 1978 (before Leonard became a world champion), has fallen apart since then, becoming addicted to <a href=""/wiki/Crack_cocaine"" title=""Crack cocaine"">crack cocaine</a>. He is now being filmed for an HBO documentary he believes to be about his ""comeback"".</p>', u'<p>On the night of an <a href=""/wiki/Card_(sports)"" title=""Card (sports)"">undercard fight</a> in <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Atlantic_City"" title=""Atlantic City"">Atlantic City</a>, Micky\'s scheduled opponent is ill, and a substitute is found who is 20 pounds heavier than Micky, a huge difference in professional boxing, constituting two or three weight classes. Despite Micky\'s reservations, his mother and brother agree to the terms so that they can all get the purse. Micky is soundly defeated by the much heavier fighter in an obvious mismatch. Frustrated with his career and embarrassed by his defeat, Micky tries to retreat from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender.</p>', u'<p>After several weeks, Alice arranges another fight for Micky, who hesitates, concerned it will turn out the same as before. His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation. Micky mentions that he\'s received an offer to be paid to train in <a href=""/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley"" title=""Las Vegas Valley"">Las Vegas</a>, but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family. Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then, once she picks up a client, <a href=""/wiki/Police_impersonation"" title=""Police impersonation"">impersonating a police officer</a> to steal the client\'s money. This is quickly foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them. Micky intervenes to try to stop the police from beating his brother, and a police officer breaks his hand before arresting him. At their arraignment, Micky is released but Dicky is sent to jail. Finally fed up, Micky washes his hands of Dicky.</p>', u'<p>On the night of the HBO documentary\'s airing, Dicky\'s family, and Dicky himself in prison, are horrified to see it is called <i><a href=""/wiki/High_on_Crack_Street:_Lost_Lives_in_Lowell"" title=""High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell"">Crack in America</a></i> and about how crack addiction ruined Dicky\'s career and life. Devastated, Dicky begins training and trying to get his life together in prison. Micky is lured back into boxing by his father, who believes Alice and his stepson Dicky are bad influences. The other members of his training team and a new manager, Sal Lanano, persuade Micky to return to boxing with the explicit understanding that his mother and brother will no longer be involved. They place Micky in minor fights to help him regain his confidence. He is then offered another major fight against an undefeated up-and-coming boxer. During a prison visit, Dicky advises Micky on how best to work his opponent, but Micky feels his brother is being selfish and trying to restart his own failed career. During the actual match, Micky is nearly overwhelmed at the beginning but then implements his brother\'s advice and is eventually triumphant; he earns the title shot for which his opponent was being groomed.</p>', u'<p>Upon his release from prison, Dicky and his mother go to see Micky train. Assuming things are as they were, Dicky prepares to spar with his brother, but Micky informs him that he\'s no longer allowed per Micky\'s agreement with his current team. In the ensuing argument, in which Micky chastises both factions of his family, Charlene and his trainer leave in disgust. Micky and Dicky spar until Micky knocks Dicky down. Dicky storms off, presumably to get high again, and Alice chides Micky, only to be sobered when he tells her that she has always favored Dicky. Dicky returns to his crack house, where he says goodbye to his friends and heads to Charlene\'s apartment. He tells her that Micky needs both of them and they need to work together. After bringing everyone back together, the group goes to <a href=""/wiki/London"" title=""London"">London</a> for the title fight. Micky scores another upset victory and the welterweight title. The film jumps a few years ahead, with Dicky, as talkative as ever, crediting his brother as the creator of his own success.</p>']"

Meanwhile, Yusuf, under assault in the first level, accidentally initiates his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, removing the gravity of Arthur\'s dream world and causing an avalanche in Eames\' dream.

Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to Limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology, where they spent ""fifty years"" of experienced time constructing a world from their shared memories while seemingly growing old together. Cobb confesses that in order to ensure Mal would leave Limbo, he had implanted the idea that her reality was false in her head in the first place; this was how he knew that inception was possible. The experience destabilised Mal, and left her convinced that she was still dreaming even after they had woken up. In an attempt to ""wake up"" from real life, Mal committed suicide, and tried desperately to persuade Cobb to do so too by incriminating him in her death. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S. His children, who appear frequently in his dreams, are in California in the care of Professor Miles, who is Mal\'s father.</p>', u'<p>Through his confession, Cobb attains catharsis and chooses to remain in Limbo to search for Saito.

All team members other than Cobb and Saito ride the synchronized kicks back to reality: Ariadne jumps off a balcony in Limbo, Eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, Arthur blasts an elevator containing the team\'s sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in Yusuf\'s dream hits the water. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo (shown <i><a href=""/wiki/In_medias_res"" title=""In medias res"">in medias res</a></i> at the start of the film) and the two remember their arrangement, presumably shooting themselves and waking to outer-world reality back on the airplane, where the entire team and Robert Fischer have awakened.</p>', u""<p>Upon arrival at Los Angeles Airport, Cobb successfully passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and his waiting father-in-law accompanies him to his children.

Finding that copper is Metro Man\'s one weakness, Megamind\'s plan to obliterate him with a death ray powered by the sun succeeds, and Megamind finally takes over the city. His joy is short lived though, as without a hero to fight, he finds his life has become meaningless. He goes to the Metroman Museum, which was dedicated to him on the day of his death and nearly runs into Roxanne. He uses his holographic watch to disguise himself as the museum\'s curator Bernard, and she innocently gives him the idea of creating a new superhero to take Metro Man\'s place.

One day in the marketplace, an orphan boy named Dastan protects his friend, Bis, from being executed by Persian soldiers. The king sees Dastan's bravery and adopts him, making him a prince of Persia. Years later, Dastan is a grown man and is still up to his rebellious ways. When Nizam receives proof that the holy city of Alamut is supplying weapons to Persian enemies, he and Tus plan to attack with Garsiv leading the siege. Ignoring Tus\u2019 command, Dastan\u2019s breech Alamut on their own, and open a gate letting the Persians in. Meanwhile, the princess of Alamut, Tamina, orders her servant Asoka to take a special dagger out of the city and protect it at all costs. During the battle, Dastan and Asoka cross paths and fight; Dastan ultimately wins and finds and keeps the dagger.</p>"", u'<p>Nizam, Tus, and Garsiv go to the Alamut\u2019s castle and order Tamina to confess to selling weapons. She denies it and Tus asks her to marry him to unite to two nations. She only accepts after seeing that Dastan is in possession of the dagger. After the siege, the king is furious with Tus for attacking the holy city of Alamut and they argue. Tus goes back to Alamut to find the weapons, and gives Dastan a prayer robe to give to the King as a gift at his banquet. There, Dastan asks the king for his approval for Tus to marry Tamina. But instead, the king proposes that Tamina be married to Dastan. Seconds later, the kings starts to scream in pain as his prayer robe has been poisoned. He dies and Garsiv accuses Dastan of being the murderer. Bis tries to help Dastan run but gets killed, and Dastan leaves with Tamina instead. After the two escape, Tus is appointed king and Dastan becomes a fugitive.</p>', u""<p>While Tamina and Dastan are hiding in the desert, Tamina attempts to kill Dastan for the dagger. During the struggle, Dastan presses the jewel on the hilt of the Dagger and the sand inside is released. As a result, time goes backward and only Dastan is aware of it. Dastan then believes that Tus invaded Alamut not because of weapon forges, but for the dagger. He and Tamina head to Avrat where the king's funeral will be held. As they are walking through the Valley of the Slaves, Tamina pretends to faint and Dastan goes to help her. She hits him over the head and knocks him unconscious. Dastan wakes up to find Tamina and the dagger gone, and meets Sheik Amar and Seso. They track down Tamina, and Dastan gives her to Sheik Amar and takes the dagger back. Tamina tells Dastan the dagger is sacred and that she is a guardian ordered by the gods to protect it, but he doesn\u2019t believe her.</p>"", u'<p>Sheik Amar recognizes Dastan and attempts to take him back to Persia for the reward money.

Dastan notices that Nizam hands are burned, and realizes that Nizam is the one who poisoned the robe and killed the king. Garsiv and the Persian soldiers see Dastan and chase him throughout the city, but he escapes again. When Tus asks Nizam why Dastan came to Avrat, Nizam lies and says Dastan tried to kill him, suggesting that Dastan be killed instead of putting him on trail. Tus disagrees, so Nizam orders the Hassansins, covert warriors, to kill Dastan and find the dagger.</p>', u'<p>Later, Dastan finds Tamina in the desert just as a sandstorm blows in. When the two seek cover from the storm, Tamina tells him the story behind the dagger. The dagger is the only thing that can pierce the sandglass, but the handle only holds one minute. Dastan realizes that Nizam\u2019s plan is to place to dagger in the sandglass and press the jewel button at the same time. This way sand would flow endlessly, causing Nizam to go back in time and prevent himself from saving Sharaman\u2019s life from a lion as children. Tamina says that in doing so, Nizam would break the sandglass, ending the world.</p>', u'<p>To stop Nizam\u2019s plans, Dastan and Tamina travel to a temple in the Hindu Kush where the dagger can be returned to the gods.

Bosco intimidates Marmaduke, who does not want to fight.</p>', u'<p>Marmaduke then meets Mazie (<a href=""/wiki/Emma_Stone"" title=""Emma Stone"">Emma Stone</a>), who develops a crush on Marmaduke. He also meets Giuseppe (<a href=""/wiki/Christopher_Mintz-Plasse"" title=""Christopher Mintz-Plasse"">Christopher Mintz-Plasse</a>), a Chinese Crested dog who is afraid of everything, and Raisin (<a href=""/wiki/Steve_Coogan"" title=""Steve Coogan"">Steve Coogan</a>), a highly intelligent but decidedly minute <a href=""/wiki/Dachshund"" title=""Dachshund"">Dachshund</a>.

Marmaduke then enters a dog surfing contest put together as a promotional stunt by Phil to sway <a href=""/wiki/Petco"" title=""Petco"">Petco</a> and beats Bosco, who is an established dog-surfing champion. They get into a fight, which appalls the Petco executives. As a result, Phil hires a dog trainer named Anton to help him control Marmaduke, albeit with little success at first.</p>', u'<p>He then takes Jezebel on Mazie\'s dream date, which the latter watches from afar. While the Winslow family are on Don\'s boat, Marmaduke throws a party, with most residents of the dog park attending save for Mazie, Giuseppe, and Raisin. Bosco crashes the party and discovers it was Carlos at the dog park. He then exposes Marmaduke, who loses his pedigree friends. He is left with no friends and a destroyed house. When the Winslows return (having discovered Phil arranged the stay on Don\'s boat was so they could work on the Petco pitch) and Phil discovers the house in a wreck, he locks Marmaduke outside for the night. Marmaduke runs away, and leaves Mazie a toy that she had given him earlier. Mazie goes to Marmaduke\'s house, and Carlos tells her Marmaduke never returned. She then goes looking for him. Marmaduke in the meantime has met Chupadogra, a wise, elderly <a href=""/wiki/English_Mastiff"" title=""English Mastiff"">English Mastiff</a> (<a href=""/wiki/Sam_Elliott"" title=""Sam Elliott"">Sam Elliott</a>) who is feared throughout Orange County for presumably killing his owner.

Marmaduke jumps in after her and Phil tries to retrieve him, as well as the fire department. The fireman saves Mazie, but loses Marmaduke in the raging water. By this time, Phil has been fired for missing the meeting for the last chance with Petco. He then runs to the aqueduct that the conduits lead to and finds Marmaduke in the raging waters. Phil begs Marmaduke to let go of the branch he\'s holding onto and let the waters carry him to Phil. He reluctantly does, and is saved. Several kids get that on video and put it on <a href=""/wiki/YouTube"" title=""YouTube"">YouTube</a>. Since it generates almost 700,000 hits, Phil is rehired. Phil then talks about moving back to Kansas, but the entire Winslow family wants to stay in California. Marmaduke later confronts the pedigrees, saying that differences shouldn\'t matter, that they\'re all dogs and should have an equal share of the park. Everyone agrees and turn on Bosco, who leaves, after revealing his fear of bees (which Marmaduke is also afraid of). Meanwhile, the YouTube video also wins the company the Petco deal. He and Don begin thinking of new commercials when they ask each other about if the dogs could talk to each other, or even dance.</p>', u'<p>The finale then shows Marmaduke, Jezebel, Mazie, Giuseppe, Raisin, and Buster, among others, dancing and singing ""<a href=""/wiki/What_I_Like_About_You_(song)"" title=""What I Like About You (song)"">What I Like About You</a>"", which turns out to be the commercial. In the end, Marmaduke and Mazie are dating, Marmaduke and Jezebel are friends, and all is well. That night, Marmaduke then farts in Phil and Debbie\'s bed as he winks at the camera.</p>']"

To Miller\'s surprise, the warehouse has not been secured, with looters making their way in and out, as soldiers from the <a href=""/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division"" title=""101st Airborne Division"">101st Airborne Division</a> are too few to do much. After a firefight with a sniper, Miller finds that the warehouse is empty, the third consecutive time he has found nothing. Later, at a debriefing, Miller brings up the point that the majority of the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Intelligence_(information_gathering)"" title=""Intelligence (information gathering)"">intel</a> given to him is inaccurate and anonymous. High-ranking officials quickly dismiss his concerns. Afterward, CIA agent Martin Brown (<a href=""/wiki/Brendan_Gleeson"" title=""Brendan Gleeson"">Brendan Gleeson</a>) tells him that the next place he is to search was inspected by a UN team two months before.</p>', u'<p>Meanwhile, Pentagon official Clark Poundstone (<a href=""/wiki/Greg_Kinnear"" title=""Greg Kinnear"">Greg Kinnear</a>) welcomes returning Iraqi exile politician Ahmed Zubaidi (Raad Rawi) at the airport.

Brown arranges for Miller to get into the prison where Al-Rawi\'s man is being interrogated. Miller is then approached by Dayne, who questions him about the false reports of WMDs. Miller bluffs his way in to see the Iraqi. Near death after being tortured, the man tells Miller that they ""did everything you asked us to in the meeting."" When Miller asks what meeting he is talking about, the man says one word: ""Jordan.""

After Miller tells her he suspects that Al-Rawi is Magellan, Dayne reluctantly confirms that Magellan met with a high-ranking official in February in Jordan.</p>', u'<p>Miller realizes that Poundstone\'s men are hunting Al-Rawi, and can think of only one reason: Al-Rawi confirmed there was no Iraqi WMD program and is now a major liability.
