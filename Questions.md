### Topics

1. Over the last few decades, is there some significant change in the topics of a) movies made and b) popular or highly rated movies? See [this paper] (http://uilab.kaist.ac.kr/research/CICLING2011/paper.pdf) for a similar idea
1. If we do a similar analysis of topics of movies for other major film industries in the world (Bollywood, Chinese, French, German, Korean, etc.), how do they compare against each other in terms of the topics?
1. How does the socio-political background of a country/region affect the topics of the movies made there? E.g. one could compare Hollywood, European, East Asian, African and Middle Eastern movies.
1. What is the topic diversity in different film industries? 

### Complexity of Plot
1. How common is non-linear narration, twists and other complexities in the plot for movies of different regions?

### Other
