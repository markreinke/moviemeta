## Questions that drive the movie meta data analysis project

### Topics
1. What topics can we find in the content of Hollywood movies? What is their distribution in terms of mumber of movies? How much of diversity of topics is there?
1. Is there some pattern of repeated topics in moveis that are highly rated or are hits in the box office?
1. Over the last few decades, is there some significant change in the topics of a) movies made and b) popular or highly rated movies? See [this paper] (http://uilab.kaist.ac.kr/research/CICLING2011/paper.pdf) for a similar idea. Also check out the topic browser [here] (http://topics.cs.princeton.edu/Science/).
1. If we do a similar analysis of topics of movies for other major film industries in the world (Bollywood, Chinese, French, German, Korean, etc.), how do they compare against each other in terms of the topics? 
2. How do the different film industries influence each other? Dotrends that occur in one industry then happen in another after some delay?
1. How does the socio-political background of a country/region affect the topics of the movies made there? E.g. one could compare Hollywood, European, East Asian, African and Middle Eastern movies.
1. What is the topic diversity in different film industries? 
2. Make recommendations of movies. (If you like movie x, you'll probably like movie y). And as a bonus (probably way beyond the scope of the project): Analyze another domain (e.g. literature) and predict: If you like this movie, you might like this book.


### Complexity of Plot
1. How common is non-linear narration, twists and other complexities in the plot for movies of different regions?

### Other
1. Any interesting patterns related to the number and type (e.g. gender, age) of the main characters?
