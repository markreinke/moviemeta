## Project Summary

Video delivery is gradually getting liberated from the traditional satellite and cable infrastructure. Also, the barriers of entry for video production and distribution is dropping significantly. As the landscape changes and the [new entrants want to achieve scale] (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/technology/netflix-faces-challengers-in-its-push-to-expand-globally.html?_r=0), understanding local sensitivities become very important. 

The high level idea of our project is to apply text mining techniques on movie mata data like plot summaries to gain non-obvious insights to the content of the movies. This analysis is carried out across different dimensions to study cultural, geographical and temporal patterns in the contents of movies.
