However, Hammond is texted by the unknown person who says that he knows what is in Hammond\'s briefcase. As Marks confronts Hammond in the rear lavatory, the latter is revealed to be smuggling <a href=""/wiki/Cocaine"" title=""Cocaine"">cocaine</a> in a brief-case.

The passengers view a mid-flight news report via their television sets, saying that Marks is the hijacker of their flight.

Marks persuades the passengers of his innocence, and together they move the bomb to the plane\'s rear and bury it with luggage to reduce the blast\'s damage and move to the front of the plane to avoid the blast. The plane has to descend to 8,000 feet, which is necessary for survival, as the low pressure of higher altitudes would rip the plane apart if the bomb exploded.

When the pixies inadvertently tell Aurora of her parentage and of Maleficent\'s true identity, a horrified Aurora runs away to her mother and her father\'s castle.</p>', u'<p>After a brief reunion with Aurora, Stefan locks her away in her room for safety. However, she is drawn by the curse to the dungeon and pricks her finger on the spindle of the spinning wheel and she falls into a deep sleep, completing the curse. Intent on saving her, Maleficent and Diaval manage to get Phillip to her room. Phillip kisses Aurora, but she does not awaken. Alone in Aurora\'s chamber, Maleficent apologizes to Aurora, swears that no harm will come to her, and kisses her forehead. To her surprise, this breaks the spell, as Maleficent\'s motherly concern for Aurora constitutes true love. Aurora forgives Maleficent and they attempt to leave the castle, but Maleficent is trapped in an iron net and attacked by Stefan and his guards. Maleficent transforms Diaval into a <a href=""/wiki/Dragon"" title=""Dragon"">dragon</a> and he lifts the net off her, but is driven back by the guards. Stefan beats and taunts Maleficent, but before he can kill her, Aurora frees Maleficent\'s wings; they fly back to her and reattach themselves.

Blinded by hatred, Stefan attempts once more to kill her, but falls off the tower to his death.</p>', u'<p>Soon after, Aurora is crowned queen of the human and fairy realms by Maleficent, unifying the two kingdoms, with Phillip beside her.

He was called Vlad the Impaler after slaughtering thousands by impaling them on spears. Eventually sickened by his acts, he put aside his past and returned to rule his domains in peace. One day in the forest, Vlad and his soldiers discover a helmet in a stream. Fearing that an Ottoman scouting party is preparing the way for invasion, they follow the stream to a high mountain cave called Broken Tooth Mountain.

If he resists the intense urge to drink human blood for three days, he will turn back into a human. Otherwise, he will remain a vampire forever and will one day be called upon to help his maker.

Dracula orders the monk to take Ingeras away, then uses his power to clear the black clouds in the sky. The sunlight burns the vampires into dust, while Dracula collapses into a charred corpse.

The play, written by <a href=""/wiki/Ben_Jonson"" title=""Ben Jonson"">Ben Jonson</a>, is halted mid-performance by the royal militia because of its allegedly seditious content. Jonson is arrested and imprisoned. Much taken by the propagandistic power of art, considering that ""all art is political ... otherwise it is just decoration"", de Vere decides to employ his secretly written plays for the promotion of the Earl of Essex\'s cause (Essex being another of the Queen\'s illegitimate sons) over the candidate preferred by the Cecils, writing <a href=""/wiki/Henry_V_(play)"" title=""Henry V (play)""><i>Henry V</i></a> and, later, <a href=""/wiki/Richard_III_(play)"" title=""Richard III (play)""><i>Richard III</i></a> as propaganda designed to foment revolution. He contacts Jonson, who is confined in the <a href=""/wiki/Tower_of_London"" title=""Tower of London"">Tower of London</a> until de Vere uses his influence to free him, in order to have his play <i>Henry V</i> staged under Jonson\'s name. Jonson is unhappy about the plan, assuming that the play will be an amateurish effort that will tarnish his name. Jonson does not claim authorship, allowing an unscrupulous young actor, William Shakespeare, to step up on stage as author. It is this ""drunken oaf"" who takes on the role as de Vere\'s front man, while Jonson becomes de Vere\'s only confidant in the truth.</p>', u'<p>Shakespeare however, having discovered the real author\'s identity, extorts money from de Vere to build the <a href=""/wiki/Globe_Theatre"" title=""Globe Theatre"">Globe Theatre</a>, and wangles \xa3400 per year for posturing as a front.

Jonson later confronts Shakespeare and accuses him of the murder.</p>', u'<p>At the climax, de Vere uses the play <i>Richard III</i> as a thinly veiled attack on the hunchbacked Robert Cecil. The plan is to incite a mob to march against Cecil, and thus weaken his position at court. At the same time, Essex is to march with the Earl of Southampton to the Palace, <a href=""/wiki/The_Earl_of_Essex_Rebellion"" title=""The Earl of Essex Rebellion"">to promote his own claim to the succession</a>. Meanwhile, de Vere writes <i><a href=""/wiki/Venus_and_Adonis_(Shakespeare_poem)"" title=""Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)"">Venus and Adonis</a></i> to remind the Queen of their old love. He hopes to see her again in an atmosphere of renewed intimacy, and to persuade her to dismiss Cecil.</p>', u'<p>However the plan fails, as a jealous Jonson, unaware of de Vere\'s plan, betrays the plot to Cecil. Jonson soon learns the plan, but fails to alert Francesco of his betrayal in time, as the mob is massacred by soldiers with muskets and artillery pieces, stopping it from joining Essex. The Queen, swayed by Cecil, thinks that Essex is trying to depose her violently. Essex and his men are lured into the Palace courtyard, where they are ambushed by soldiers firing muskets from the balconies above. Essex and Southampton surrender honorably. Essex is later executed, but not before screaming ""God save the Queen!"". Southampton is later released.</p>', u'<p>Robert Cecil then tells a broken de Vere that Elizabeth had other bastard sons \u2013 one of whom was de Vere himself. If true, it would mean that de Vere committed incest with his mother. He has a private audience with Elizabeth, at which the Queen agrees to save Southampton, but insists that de Vere remain anonymous as the true author of ""Shakespeare\'s"" works.</p>', u'<p>After the Queen\'s death, James VI succeeds as James I of England, though Cecil\'s hopes of a more puritanical regime are shattered when James reveals himself to be an avid ""theater man"". Shakespeare retires on his ill-gotten gains to Stratford to become a businessman, and de Vere dies in 1604, having commended his manuscripts to the care of a repentant Ben Jonson. Cecil however still wants the manuscripts destroyed. With the destruction of The Rose, he believes them burnt, but Jonson later discovers they have survived. Nevertheless, the ""truth"" remains concealed: that Edward de Vere, not the nearly illiterate Shakespeare, is their real author.</p>']"

Goldmoon is an amalgamation of several crime gangs that were assimilated by the dominant Jaebum clan. Jung Chung was the former head of the Chinese-descended Northmoon gang, the largest of Jaebum\'s rival gangs, until it merged, and has since become executive director of Goldmoon. Lee Joong-go is the former second-in-command of the Jaebum clan, but was pushed down by Jung after the merging and serves as one of the managing directors instead, despite being backed by the Jaebum faction, which as a whole holds the most power. Jang Su-Ki, as the vice chair of Goldmoon, is officially the heir apparent but his clan was dissolved during the merging and his position in the group is strictly a formality, with no real power or involvement in day-to-day operations of the syndicate. Although Jung has the highest chance of becoming the heir, Jung\'s right-hand man, Ja-Sung (<a href=""/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae"" title=""Lee Jung-jae"">Lee Jung-jae</a>), is really an undercover police officer.

They first ask Ja-sung to leak incriminating evidence about Jung. Then they go to Jung, and convince him to leak evidence about his rival Lee in exchange for not being prosecuted. Once Lee is in jail, they inform Lee that Jung betrayed him, the result of which is that Lee sends directions for Jung\'s murder.</p>', u""<p>Jung remains confused as to how the police got the evidence against him, and is insulted when Chief Kang refuses a bribe from Jung in a later meeting.

He spares Ja-sung because they have become good friends to the point of Jung calling Ja-sung his brother, and proceeds to murder the other two. Shortly after, Lee's followers attack Jung's faction, during which Jung, whilst killing most of his assailants, is mortally wounded. While lying in the hospital near his death, Jung tells Ja-Sung that he needs to decide his loyalty, stating it will be the only way he can survive.</p>"", u""<p>Chief Kang breaks his promise to Ja-Sung once more by refusing to let him disappear, instead making him Jang's vice chairman upon Jang becoming chairman, thus giving Ja-sung more access to sensitive information that can take down the syndicate in the future. Moreover, Ja-sung's wife, who has been secretly spying on him on Chief Kang's behalf, was pregnant, but the stress from Ja-sung's profession and her own spy work, along the sudden shock of an attempted hit by Lee's men, results in a miscarriage. It also happens at this point that Lee is released from jail, due to the evidence against him proving to be insufficient. Lee will certainly seek the death of Ja-Sung but Chief Kang show no concern for this, due to Lee seemingly losing all his power after the attack on Jung's faction and the public fiasco afterward resulting in his entire faction being banished from the syndicate.</p>"", u""<p>Jang, who is poised to succeed, tries to kill Ja-Sung, an event which Chief Kang anticipated but also did nothing to stop.

Feeling deeply betrayed by Chief Kang's constant refusal to let him walk away, Ja-Sung decides to become a full criminal.

In this instance, Charlotte uses the exact opposite excuse, saying that it would be better if they waited until the last day of the holiday, and then something could potentially happen between them. Heartbroken, Tim realizes that Charlotte is not attracted to him and that time travel will not make it possible for him to change her mind.</p>', u'<p>After the summer, Tim moves to London to pursue a career as a barrister.

Each Jaeger is controlled by two or more pilots whose brains are linked, called ""drifting"" to share the heavy mental load of operating the machine. The Jaegers are initially effective, but many are destroyed as the Kaijus grow more powerful and their attacks become more frequent.</p>', u""<p>In 2020,Raleigh and his brother Yancy Becket, are instructed to suit up to fight a Kaiju labeled Knifehead, a designated category III in danger and size. They wade out into the Pacific in their Jaeger, Gipsy Danger, with orders to kill the Kaiju and save the city. They are told to ignore the small fishing boat, Saltchuck that is in the middle of the battle. Raleigh ignores the command, and attempts to save the ship. He and Yancy believe they are victorious after shooting Knifehead with the plasma cannon built into the right arm, and prepare to leave. Knifehead reappears and attacks as the Jaeger is turned, ripping off Gipsy Danger's left arm, and causing Raleigh permanent damage. Knifehead then attacks the head, ripping it open and killing Yancy. Raleigh pilots the Jaeger solo, killing Knifehead, but receiving severe damage to Gipsy Danger in the process. He limped the Jaeger ashore on the Alaskan coast, much to the amazement of a father and son who witness the event. Raliegh emerges from the broken hull of Gipsy Danger dazed and bloodied before falling to the ground unconscious while the father sends his son off to get medical help. Traumatized by the sudden loss of his brother while still mentally connected to him, Raleigh quits the Jaeger Program.</p>"", u'<p>In 2025, the participating governments deem the Jaeger program unsustainable and discontinue and decommission it in favor of building defensive coastal walls, collectively called the Kaiju Wall. The four remaining Jaegers are redeployed to <a href=""/wiki/Hong_Kong"" title=""Hong Kong"">Hong Kong</a> to protect the coast until the walls are completed. Jaeger commander Marshall Stacker Pentecost resolves to make a last-ditch attempt to end the Kaiju threat by destroying The Breach with a <a href=""/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"" title=""Nuclear weapon"">nuclear weapon</a>, even though past nuclear strikes on the portal have been unsuccessful. Stacker plans to follow through with the initial Jaeger objective, regardless of the lack of funding. He flies to the Kaiju Wall, where Raleigh has been working for the past five years. Raleigh and the other workers are watching the news, which shows the Wall failing and a Kaiju named Mutavore attacking Sydney, Australia, before it\'s stopped by the Jaeger Striker Eureka, piloted by Herc and Chuck Hansen. Chuck asserts that the reason the Jaeger program failed was because of weak pilots. Stacker asks Raleigh to re-join the program, but he declines. He and his brother were still connected when he died and he cannot stand the mental pain another time. Stacker asks where he would rather die: building the Wall, ""or in a Jaeger,"" fighting Kaiju. Raliegh reluctantly returns to the Jaeger Program.</p>', u""<p>Raleigh travels to Hong Kong with Pentecost and begins the process of finding a new co-pilot.When they arrive in Hong Kong, they are greeted by Mako Mori, later revealed as Pentecost's adopted daughter and director of the Jaeger refurbishment project. She shows Raleigh around the Shatterdome. They get into an elevator with two scientists, Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb, who comprise the entire research team for the base. The Jaegers stationed in the Shatterdome are all the remaining mechs; Crimson Typhoon, which features three arms and is piloted by the Wei triplets. The second is called Cherno Alpha, piloted by a pair of Russians, Sasha and Aleksis Kaidonovsky. Herc and Chuck Hansen pilot the only Mark-5, Striker Eureka. Mako then shows Raleigh to Gipsy Danger, who has been rebuilt with additional weapons for the final mission. She then shows him to his room, right across from hers.</p>"", u""<p>Pentecost reluctantly allows Mako to participate in a test run with Raleigh. During the test, Mako relives the traumatic memory of the Kaiju attack (Onibaba) that orphaned her and nearly discharges <i>Gipsy Danger</i>\u200d\u200a'\u200bs weapons in the hangar. Pentecost deems her unfit for combat and grounds both her and Raleigh. She tells him that he will meet with the candidates for his partnership soon, and that she hopes to be a pilot one day. Her record is impressive, but she makes it clear that Stacker will not allow her to fight. She then goes to her room, but watches him from the door as he changes. In the mess hall, Raleigh is invited by Herc to sit with him and Chuck, but Chuck takes an instant dislike to Raleigh because he believes him to be weak, and fears that he will endanger their mission. Herc apologizes for his behavior, making it known that his son is a hothead and very impulsive. Stacker then goes to meet with the scientists. Gottleib tells him that, based on the data, they can expect a Double Event soon, and a triple soon afterward. Newton asserts that he believes he can connect with the Kaiju via Drift, the same as pilots in the Jaeger program do. Stacker dismisses him, telling him that it's impossible, and goes with Gottlieb's information instead.[5]</p>"", u""<p>Against his better judgement, Stacker appoints Mako as Raleigh's partner, and they do a test run in Gipsy Danger. Stacker is called away by a frightened Gottlieb, who tells him that Newton attempted the link anyway, and has collapsed in seizures on the floor. Chuck and Raleigh fight when Chuck insults Mako, but are broken up by Herc, while Raleigh and Mako go in to talk to Stacker. Stacker tells Mako that she is too inexperienced, and won't be piloting again, and Mako leaves. Raleigh strikes out at Stacker, saying that he knows why he won't let Mako fight, since he's been in her memories. The kaiju that was hunting Mako was killed by the Jaeger that Stacker piloted, and he took her under his wing after that. Raleigh says that he is only hindering Mako, but Stacker says that he has made up his mind.[</p>"", u""<p>A pair of Category IV Kaijus, codenamed Otachi and Leatherback are detected by Tendo attack Hong Kong. Striker Eureka, Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha are deployed to fend off the Kaiju. Herc and Chuck are supposed to remain back by the island as a last resort to avoid being damaged, while the Wei Tang triplets and the Kaidonovskys attack the two Kaiju. The Kaiju swiftly destroy Crimson Typhoon, prompting Herc and Chuck to assist. Striker Eureka arrives and joins the battle against Leatherback and Otachi, but not before the creatures overpower Cherno Alpha. Otachi then moved to attack Hong Kong. Leatherback triggers an EMP, disabling both Striker Eureka and the command center. Tendo says it will take two hours to get it all back online, so Stacker deploys Mako and Raleigh, as Gipsy Danger's nuclear core was unaffected by the EMP. They defeat Leatherback, saving the Hansens as well as Striker Eureka, though Herc breaks his arm after Leatherback lands a blow on the mech's head.</p>"", u'<p>Meanwhile, scientist Newton Geiszler creates a device that allows him to drift with a damaged Kaiju brain. He discovers that the Kaijus are not merely wild animals, but are <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Bioweapon"" title=""Bioweapon"">genetically engineered weapons</a>, hive-minded at the vanguard of an invading alien army called the Precursors. They came to Earth once before during the time of the Dinosaurs, but there was too much oxygen in the atmosphere and that the humans practically terraformed it for them. Stacker instructs Newton to do another link, with a fresh brain, which he can get from the black market dealer Hannibal Chau. Seeking more information, Pentecost orders Geiszler to repeat the experiment on an intact Kaiju brain and sends him to Hannibal Chau, a criminal who sells Kaiju body parts on the black market. When he finds him, he is astounded to see that Chau has equipment and specimens that even the government doesn\'t have. Newton tells Chau that he wants to establish another link, and Chau tells him that it\'s dangerous because now the Kaiju know where Newton is and will want to kill him. He dismisses Newton as Otachi storms the city, and Newton heads to a public Kaiju bunker.[5]</p>', u""<p>The bunker is attacked by Otachi, who breaks through the shelter's roof while searching. Gipsy Danger then attacks, and they fight through the city streets before Otachi flies up with Gipsy Danger in her clutches. Mako deploys Gipsy's sword, and they bisect Otachi before falling to the earth. Stacker reveals after they return that he is very ill, due to radiation poisoning from piloting the Mark-1 Coyote Tango. [5]</p>"", u""<p>Newton goes back to Chau's store, and demands the brain from the dead Kaiju. Chau relents, and he and his team go to harvest the parts from the carcass.

While running, Newton slips as the infant asphyxiates itself with its umbilical cord, only to eat Chau before finally dying.</p>"", u""<p>Stacker decides to put the final plan into motion early, knowing that they won't survive the triple attack Gottlieb predicted. The final plan is to go through the portal and destroy it with a high-yield nuclear bomb, so that the Kaiju can no longer get through. Gipsy Danger is supposed to run protection, giving enough time for Chuck and Herc to get through the portal to deploy the bomb. However, with Herc injured, and little time to find another pilot, Stacker decides to partner with Chuck, knowing that they could all die if he didn't.</p>"", u""<p>Herc and Chuck say goodbye to each other, knowing that Chuck will most likely not return. Meanwhile, Newton has decided to link with the newborn brain, and Gottlieb joins him. They realize that the plan will not work, and return to the base. When they get a hold of the two Jaegers, they tell them that the portal will only respond to the genetic code of a Kaiju, and that they must use a Kaiju or a part of one to get through the portal to destroy it, or else the bomb would deflect and only affect Earth. Geiszler and his lab partner Hermann Gottlieb link with the infant Kaiju's brain and learns that The Breach only opens for Kaiju DNA, which is why all previous attempts to destroy the portal have failed.</p>"", u'<p>The two remaining Jaegers commence their bombing run on The Breach. Pentecost volunteers to pilot <i>Striker Eureka</i>, which is the only one capable of carrying the bomb.The two Jaegers engage the Triple Event Kaiju - Scunner, Raiju and Slattern - with the latter the strongest of the three, the first Category V Kaiju as well as the largest ever encountered. Both Jaegers take heavy damage in the process.<i>Striker Eureka</i> is too damaged to release the bomb. Geiszler warns the two Jaegers that they must take a Kaiju into the Breach with them for the attack to succeed.Stacker and Chuck decide to deploy the bomb, sacrificing Striker and themselves to try and kill Scunner and Slattern to give Mako and Raleigh a chance to get through the portal. Pentecost and Chuck Hansen detonate the bomb in order to clear a path to the portal for Raleigh and Mako. Since <i>Gipsy Danger</i> is powered by a <a href=""/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_core"" title=""Nuclear reactor core"">nuclear reactor core</a>, it can be used as an improvised bomb to destroy The Breach. The resulting explosion destroys <i>Striker Eureka</i> and kills Pentecost and Hansen, Raiju, but only injures Slattern.</p>', u""<p>The battle with Raiju and Scunner leaves <i>Gipsy Danger</i> crippled. A heavily damaged Gipsy approaches the portal but is attacked by a weakened, though not dead Slattern. Gipsy tackles Slattern, killing it with her sword and chest turbine, then passes through the portal latched onto its corpse. The Gipsy Danger crew are losing oxygen rapidly, so Raleigh gives Mako his share, and deploys her ejection pod. He then proceeds to manually overload the nuclear reactor just as Gipsy enters the Anteverse. Raleigh ejects himself out and back to Earth seconds before Gipsy Danger is set to self-destruct and detonates, on the other side of the portal, decimating the alien forces, their base and sealing off the Breach. Raleigh is able to jettison his escape pod and return to Earth before the portal collapses. Mako and Raleigh's escape pods surface safely in the Pacific.</p>"", u'<p>The two pods reach the surface, but Raleigh\'s is not responding with a pulse, and they fear that he is dead. Mako swims to Raleigh\'s pod, opening it, and hugging him in relief. He jokes that he couldn\'t breathe because she was holding him and embracing too tightly. Tendo tells them that rescue helicopters are on their way to get them, and that they\'ve done well. Herc then addressed the Shatterdome as ""Marshal,"" telling them to stop the war clock that counted down how much more time until the next attack, and the PPDC breaks out in cheers.</p>', u'<p>After initial credits roll, a mid credits sequence shows Hannibal Chau slicing himself out of the belly of the infant kaiju that swallowed him whole, demanding his missing shoe.

Inspired by this extraordinary snail, Tito dreams to revive the strip mall with Theo as an attraction, and eventually with the help of the snails who manage to divert and strand a tour bus and drum up impressive business.

Undeterred, Turbo enters the race the next day, but the dangerous racetrack and the more experienced competitors leave him trailing in last place. At a pitstop, Whiplash and his crew give Turbo a vital pep talk, advising him to stop racing like a car. Back in the race, Turbo realizes what they mean and uses his small size to his advantage. With the snail rapidly gaining in the standings, Gagn\xe9 starts racing dirty and manages to knock Turbo against the circuit wall, damaging his shell and weakening his speed powers.</p>', u""<p>Eventually, in the final stretch with Turbo in the lead, Gagn\xe9 tries a desperate maneuver to beat the snail and gets into a major crash that snares most of the competitors in a major pileup. Similarly, Turbo is thrown, waking up from unconsciousness with his shell punctured and his speed gone. Alarmed at seeing Turbo giving up, Chet puts himself into incredible dangers to meet up with Whiplash's crew to get to the racer. Seeing his brother and the crew arrive on crows to encourage him to continue, Turbo resumes the race. Unfortunately, Gagn\xe9, refusing to lose, single-mindedly pursues him by dragging his wrecked car after the snail and attempts to crush him. At the last second, Chet tells Turbo to tuck and roll into his shell at Gagn\xe9's last blow and the force allows him to tumble past the finish line to win. Gagn\xe9 is then attacked by Kim-Ly.</p>"", u""<p>At this victory, Starlight Plaza becomes a major attraction with all the businesses becoming spectacular successes including extremely elaborate snail races with Whiplash's crew getting special propulsion aids for their shells, while Chet is content as the track referee.

With K out of the picture, the ArcNet was never deployed, and there is nothing to protect the present-day Earth from the Boglodite invasion, so J must travel back in time to stop Boris and save K. Back in 1969, he travels to Coney Island, knowing from the Agency\'s records that, in 1969, Boris will commit a murder there. He finds Boris, but is discovered and arrested by 1969 K, who prepares to wipe his memory, but decides at the last minute to investigate J\'s claims.

Using his time-travel device, J evades an attack by 2012 Boris and knocks him off one of the launch tower bridges. K shoots off 1969 Boris\'s left arm (which restores the timeline), knocking him off the tower as well. The ArcNet is attached and deploys successfully when the rocket launches, with 2012 Boris being incinerated by the rocket\'s exhaust. 1969 Boris then attacks K on the beach, but the colonel pushes K down and out of the way, taking the hit himself instead. K then kills Boris (which 2012 K had regretted not doing) instead of arresting him as he originally did. The colonel\'s young son inquires about his father, but rather than tell him the truth, K wipes his memory and tells him only that his father is a hero.

Thomas wants the same ballerina to portray the innocent, fragile White Swan as well as her dark, sensual twin, the Black Swan. Nina auditions for the part, performing flawlessly as the White Swan, but not quite able to emulate the characteristics of the Black Swan. Although Nina does not do well during her audition, she approaches Thomas and asks him to reconsider her as the lead role. He tells her she is the ideal dancer to cast as the White Swan, but she lacks the passion needed to correctly portray the Black Swan.</p>', u'<p>Nina at first reluctantly accepts this and decides to leave when Thomas stops her and chides her for giving up too easily. Though he praises her technique, he criticizes her machine-like performance, saying that he has never once seen her lose herself. Nina says that she wants to be perfect, to which Thomas retorts by saying that perfection isn\'t about control, it\'s about \'letting go.\' When Thomas forcibly kisses Nina, she displays a change of character and bites him, convincing him to cast her as the Swan Queen. An intoxicated Beth angrily confronts Thomas and Nina. She is later hit by a car and seriously injured in what Thomas suspects was a suicide attempt. Nina begins to witness strange happenings. Thomas, meanwhile, becomes increasingly critical of her ""frigid"" dancing and advises her to stop being a perfectionist and to lose herself in the role. Thomas points to Lily (<a href=""/wiki/Mila_Kunis"" title=""Mila Kunis"">Mila Kunis</a>), another dancer in the company, whom he describes as lacking Nina\'s flawless technique but possessing an uninhibited quality that Nina has not shown.

The next morning, Nina wakes up alone and late for rehearsal. When she arrives at the studio, she finds Lily dancing as the Swan Queen. Furious, she confronts Lily and asks her why she did not wake her up that morning. After Lily admits she spent the night with a man whom she met at the club, Nina realizes she dreamed the encounter. Nina\'s hallucinations become stronger as she sees Thomas and Lily have sex in a backstage area and Beth stabbing herself in the face at the hospital with a nail file which Nina drops bloodied in the elevator.</p>', u""<p>Nina later has a violent argument with her mother, after which she passes out.

Back in her dressing room before the final act, Nina is congratulated by Lily, revealing that their fight was, again, imaginary. The mirror, however, is still shattered. Nina removes a small shard from her own body and realizes she had stabbed herself.

After fighting off a hostile alien, they manage to regroup and team up with a group of <a href=""/wiki/Army_National_Guard"" title=""Army National Guard"">Army National Guard</a> soldiers from the <a href=""/wiki/40th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)"" title=""40th Infantry Division (United States)"">40th Infantry Division</a>, and an Air Force <a href=""/wiki/Intelligence_assessment"" title=""Intelligence assessment"">intelligence</a> <a href=""/wiki/United_States_Air_Force#Technical_Sergeant"" title=""United States Air Force"">TSgt.</a>, Elena Santos (<a href=""/wiki/Michelle_Rodriguez"" title=""Michelle Rodriguez"">Michelle Rodriguez</a>). At the police station, the platoon finds five civilians: veterinarian Michele (Moynahan), children Hector Rincon (Cass), Kirsten (King) Amy (Gould), and Hector\'s father Joe (Pe\xf1a). A helicopter arrives to evacuate the wounded Marines, but cannot rescue the civilians due to weight restrictions. As the helicopter takes off, it is destroyed by alien air forces, killing Grayston, Guerrero, Lenihan and Simmons.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-film_5-2""><a href=""#cite_note-film-5""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>', u'<p>The Marines commandeer a city bus for evacuation.

They also learn that the alien aircraft are drones that track down humans through <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Radio_transmission"" title=""Radio transmission"">radio transmissions</a>. Santos reveals that her original mission was to locate the aliens\' central command center, believing that its destruction would deactivate the drones. On the <a href=""/wiki/Interstate_10_in_California"" title=""Interstate 10 in California"">I-10 freeway</a>, the bus comes under attack. Because the off-ramp is destroyed, the Marines are forced to <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Rappel"" title=""Rappel"">rappel</a> the civilians off the freeway. Marines Stavrou (Pesi) and Mottola (Liao) are killed, while Joe and Lt. Martinez are wounded. Martinez sacrifices himself to destroy the enemy unit by detonating explosives inside the bus, leaving Nantz in command. The surviving Marines Nantz, Santos, Imlay, Kerns, Lockett, Harris, Adukwu and the civilians escape the bombing zone. A news report speculates that the aliens are seeking Earth\'s water for fuel while attempting to colonize the planet and eradicate humans. The team prepares for the bombing, but nothing happens. Returning to the FOB, the Marines find that it is destroyed and the military is retreating from Los Angeles. The Marines plan to escort the civilians to an alternate extraction point. Joe dies from his wounds and Lockett confronts Nantz over his brother, <a href=""/wiki/Corporal#United_States_Marine_Corps"" title=""Corporal"">Cpl.</a> Dwayne G. Lockett and the others who were killed in Nantz\'s last tour. They come to peace when Nantz explains that he thinks of them every day, and recites each person\'s name, rank &amp; serial number. Nantz then says that the surviving marines should move forward united to honor Lt. Martinez, Corporal Stavrou, Lance Corporal Mattola and Hector\'s father. They successfully reach the extraction point and evacuate through a helicopter.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-film_5-3""><a href=""#cite_note-film-5""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>', u'<p>In mid-air, their copter experiences a brief loss of power. Nantz theorizes that they are hovering over a location occupied by the alien command center as it relays radio energy to its drones. He decides to recon the area alone, but his team insists on accompanying him. Searching underground, the Marines confirm the presence of a large alien vessel. Kerns radios in to request for missiles, which Nantz manually directs using a <a href=""/wiki/Laser_designator"" title=""Laser designator"">laser designator</a> while the others defend his position. Despite Kerns being killed when a Drone spots his position, the Marines succeed in routing a missile in a direct hit to the command module, which crashes. The alien ground forces retreat as their uncontrolled drones are rendered useless, just as reinforcements for the Marines arrive. Back at base, Nantz and the team are greeted as heroes. Nantz, Santos, Imlay, Lockett, Harris, and Adukwu are the sole survivors out of the original platoon. Despite orders to rest, the team joins the rest of the Marines in retaking Los Angeles as other countries wage similar military operations against the hostile species.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-film_5-4""><a href=""#cite_note-film-5""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>']"

He is comatose and missing most of his body, hooked up to neural sensors. The cockpit capsule is in his imagination, his brain\'s way of making sense of a missing environment.

He asks Christina what she would do if she knew that she only had seconds left to live, and starts to kiss her. At the same time, Goodwin approaches the air-tight chamber that contains the torso of Steven\'s comatose mutilated body, and disconnects the life support. Rutledge bangs on the outer door in vain.

2011,KR,Megamind,boxofficemojo,United States,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megamind,"[u'<p>Megamind is a super intelligent alien who was evacuated from his homeworld as a baby, as was Metro Man; the two fall into paths of super villainy and superheroism respectively and grow up as rivals fighting for control of Metro City. Megamind is consistently defeated by Metroman and is in prison. After using a holographic watch to escape with the aid of Minion, a talking fish with the robotic body of a gorilla, he kidnaps Metro Man\'s supposed love interest, reporter Roxanne Ritchi and holds her hostage to lure him into a trap. Finding that copper is Metro Man\'s one weakness, Megamind\'s plan to obliterate him with a death ray powered by the sun succeeds, and Megamind finally takes over the city. His joy is short lived though, as without a hero to fight, he finds his life has become meaningless. He goes to the Metroman Museum, which was dedicated to him on the day of his death and nearly runs into Roxanne. He uses his holographic watch to disguise himself as the museum\'s curator Bernard, and she innocently gives him the idea of creating a new superhero to take Metro Man\'s place. After creating a formula from Metroman\'s DNA, Roxanne intervenes in his plans and he accidentally injects the serum into Hal Stewart, Roxanne\'s dimwitted cameraman, who has an unrequited crush on her. Under the guise of his ""Space Dad"", Megamind tries to mold Hal into a superhero named Titan (misheard by Hal as ""Tighten""), as it was the only name he could trademark. Unfortunately, Hal\'s ambitions are crushed when he sees Roxanne and Megamind as Bernard on a date. However, Megamind\'s disguise falters during dinner and she rejects him, causing him to lose track of his invisible car which contains the gun capable of removing Hal\'s powers.</p>', u""<p>On the day of their planned battle, Hal doesn't show up and Megamind finds that he has been using his powers for ill-gotten gains and wants to team up with Megamind to take over Metro City. Megamind tells Hal that he tricked him, revealing his Space Dad and Bernard disguises, but that infuriates Hal, who tries to destroy Megamind. Megamind activates a failsafe to trap Hal in copper as it was Metro Man's weakness, but that too fails. After he escapes, Megamind pleads with Roxanne for help, and they go to Metro Man's hideout to search for clues to why the copper didn't work. Instead they find Metro Man, still alive but having been disillusioned with the life of a superhero, he chose to fake his death in order to pursue a career in music. He refuses to help despite the danger, but encourages Megamind that good will always rise up against evil. Not seeing himself as a hero, Megamind gives up and returns to prison. Meanwhile, Hal kidnaps Roxanne and holds her hostage to call Megamind out of hiding. Megamind begs the Warden to release him to face this threat, inadvertently apologizing for an argument he'd had with Minion earlier that caused the two to separate. Minion reveals himself under the Warden's disguise and the two leave to face Hal together.</p>"", u""<p>At Metro Tower, Hal threatens to send it toppling into the city with Roxanne tied to the roof. Megamind appears and tricks Hal, freeing Roxanne and the two flee as he throws the tower at them. Roxanne gets away, but Megamind is struck by the tower's antenna and appears near death. Metro Man finally appears and chases Hal away from the scene as Roxanne discovers that the Megamind that saved her was actually Minion, and that Metro Man is actually Megamind in disguise. He successfully scares Hal off, but accidentally mispronounces the city's name as Metrocity, as Megamind often did and Hal returns. Finding the invisible car, Megamind grabs the diffuser gun just as Hal hurls him into the sky. To avoid falling to his death, Megamind dehydrates himself and lands with the gun in the fountain in front of Hal, re-hydrating and then hitting him with the gun, removing the villain's powers and returning him to normal. Now hailed as heroes, Megamind and Minion appear at the reopening of Metro Man's museum, now dedicated to Megamind instead while Metro Man, in disguise within the crowd silently congratulates his former rival.</p>"", u'<p>In a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Mid-credits_scene"" title=""Mid-credits scene"">mid-credits scene</a> Minion is doing the laundry when a re-hydrated Bernard pops out of the washing machine.

Their act flops and they lose to the more mainstream girl group, Pure (played by <a href=""/wiki/After_School_(band)"" title=""After School (band)"">After School</a>) . They move into a new studio where they hope to practice and record their next hit, and finally make it to the top. There is tension and rivalry between the four members of ""Pink Dolls"" - Je-ni, a singer insecure with hitting high notes, A-rang, a singer addicted to cosmetic surgery, Shin-ji, who can\'t sing, but is an excellent dancer, and Eun-ju, the eldest and former backup dancer who despite being the oldest, is constantly bullied by the younger three.</p>', u'<p>Eun-ju discovers a tape in the studio entitled ""White"" which turns out to be an old unreleased music video that her manager thinks might have the right moves and addictive tune to pave the way for the group\'s success. Since the rights to the song are unknown, the copyright issues are sidelined and their manager gives the okay for them to begin deconstructing the video for their next performance. They perform ""White"" on stage, becoming an overnight sensation and with the rise in popularity, the girls find themselves becoming resentful of each other and ruled by their desire for the chance to be promoted as the lead singer or ""main"" (who will now be singled out by wearing a white wig and costume).</p>', u'<p>First to fall victim to the curse is Je-ni, who, after recording for the lead but still failing to hit the high notes, is mysteriously hung in the studio recording booth after overdosing on her medicine. Next, A-rang becomes the lead but starts reacting to her makeup which causes her eyes to swell and turn red. She suspects Shin-ji tampered with her cosmetics so she could be the lead, and uploads unflattering pictures of Shin-ji to the internet decreasing her popularity and insuring that Ah-rang would be able to hold on to her spot as lead. After a terrifying experience in the make up room, A-rang is being prepared for the ""White"" music video with a camera strapped around her waist. Meanwhile, Shin-ji argues with their manager and storms off, refusing to sing because she was denied the lead part for a second time. When recording starts, A-Rang feels something claw at her eyes, causing her to fall off the stage. She is taken to the same hospital as Je-ni and the doctors inform the others that due to a negative reaction to the cosmetic surgery done to modify her face she will be unable to perform.</p>', u'<p>Eun-ju suspects a connection to the lead\'s bad luck and ""White"" so she asks her friend Soon-ye to dig up anything she can related to the song\'s original singer and the studio before she becomes the \'main\'. Shin-ji becomes more arrogant and practices her dancing constantly due in part to her resentfulness for originally forming \'Pure\' after 8 years of hard work then being replaced by a group of newcomers by the studio.</p>', u'<p>Soon-ye tells Eun-ju that the singer from the video was an ultra competitive girl named Jang Ye-bin who died in a studio fire 15 years ago and was blamed for the suicide of a back-up dancer. The video was never released because something went wrong with the recording and it was scheduled for a re-shoot which was never filmed due to the fire. They review the tape and see that the singer\'s face is scarred on both cheeks, and come to the conclusion that Jang Ye-bin wrote the song ""White"", and out of jealousy the other girls damaged her face so she couldn\'t have the lead position. At the same time Shin-ji is practicing and encounters the ghost. Still terrified, she participates in a reality show where she has to exit a dark building and pass obstacles to escape. She sees the ghost again in the building and exits but is surrounded by crazed fans who block her path. As she tries to get past, her hair is caught in a high rise camera that proceeds to swing her above the crowd until its counter weights fall out and crash to the ground, with Shin-ji being crushed under it. Eun-ju is reluctant to be the lead until she can find a way to lift whatever curse was on the song.</p>', u""<p>She talks with the sponsor and returns to the studio where she gets flashes of a girl dying in that room. She smashes a power cord set under a concealed spot in the floor and the remains of a suicide note are found. She proclaims that Jang Ye-bin started the fire to kill herself, and makes an offering at Ye-bin's grave, placing a photo of her on top of it and believes her career over due to her scarred face. After she leaves the grave, however, the glass on Ye-bin's photo suddenly cracks, obscuring her face.</p>"", u'<p>Now confident that the curse has been lifted, Eun-ju starts a solo career using ""White""\'s popularity. She undergoes a total transformation, bleaching her hair, answering to White as her name, denying ever being a back up, and taking credit for writing the song and choreography. When her former group members wake in the hospital, they see Eun-ju on the television as a full blown celebrity and about to compete against ""Pure"" for the #1 song. They don\'t believe the story about the curse, instead suggesting she poisoned them to gain popularity and visited the sponsor to make sure she got to remain the lead. Soon-ye is visibly upset at Eun-ju\'s new selfishness and begins to rid herself of the ""White"" recordings until she hears something new on the original track. When she goes back to the studio she discovers it isn\'t Ye-bin singing.</p>', u'<p>""White"" was originally written by a young bullied back-up dancer whose face was disfigured by Jang Ye-bin and the rest of the dancers with acid for ""standing out"" - the girls hold the dancer still while Ye-bin pours the acid on her face and then taunts her by saying ""Have fun being the main now, see how far you go with a face like that!"" The girl committed suicide by drinking bleach, and now returns to haunt and kill whoever sings ""her"" song, beginning with getting revenge on Ye-bin (the ghost caused the fire - originally a small fire that Ye-bin started to destroy the girl\'s suicide note - to go out of control and burn her to death). At the same time, Soon-ye had discovers that Jang Ye-bin was not the author of the song, but the first victim of the curse.</p>', u'<p>Soon-ye calls Eun-ju to warn her but is hung up on. Je-ni, A-rang and Shin-ji (who could only get a small gig co-hosting a tacky song and dance show) experience hot flashes like they did right before their \'accidents\' and commit suicide on air by drinking bleach (after being seemingly possessed by the ghost), and Eun-ju (after winning the competition) is assaulted by the ghost while performing ""White"" onstage, causing a blackout and the stage lights to explode, panicking the crowd. Her ""sponsor"", Mr. Choi, dies when he\'s crushed by a falling light while trying to escape and her manager is killed when she steps on stage to help and a stage flare burns her to death. Soon-ye arrives and tries to get to the stage but as Eun-ju jumps into the crowd to reach her, she trips, resulting in her being trampled to death. The film concludes with Soon-ye at the karaoke bar, disposing of Eun-ju\'s album, the trainee\'s suicide note and the original video tape by placing them in a trash can and setting it on fire. She believes she has finally defeated the curse, but then looks up in horror as the karaoke machine announces ""Song chosen: White"", implying that the curse has not been broken and she too will die (she had performed vocal doubling for the song earlier, due to Je-ni\'s being too insecure to properly hit the high notes).</p>']"

Their heroic defense of the area was actually a turning point in the Korean War. <i>71: Into the Fire</i> tells the story of these student-soldiers over the course of that fateful day.</p>', u'<p>Oh Jang-Beom, a volunteer militia student-soldier in a battle inside <a href=""/wiki/Yeongdeok_County"" title=""Yeongdeok County"">Yeongdeok</a>, <a href=""/wiki/North_Gyeongsang_Province"" title=""North Gyeongsang Province"">North Gyeongsang Province</a>. He is ordered to run around and deliver supplies to soldiers in need, and help with any injured soldiers. As the city is later overrun with North Korean troops, he is grabbed by Lieutenant Kim Jun-Seop and pulled behind a building to hide with him and his platoon. They move through the alleyways where they run into North Koreans attacking from both ends of the narrow alley. Eventually all were killed except for Kim, Jang-Beom, and a North Korean soldier. During the fight, the lieutenant pushes Jang-Beom out of the way to save him, when he is shot by the last North Korean, who charges and stabs him with his bayonet and pins him to a wall. Jang-Beom, mortified, searches his pockets for a rifle round, but is unable to kill the North Korean due to his fright. Another South Korean unit shows up and kills the North Korean soldier, and they help the wounded officer to a field hospital in <a href=""/wiki/Pohang"" title=""Pohang"">Pohang</a>. Feeling guilty, Jang-Beom stays with the commander, and tries to comfort him, but he soon dies from loss of blood and his wounds. He puts the bloody rifle round which could have saved the officer into his pocket and keeps it as a memento.</p>', u'<p>Oh Jang-beom is later forced into becoming the leader of a student-soldier unit, simply because he is one of only three of the students who has combat experience (even then, he had been more of a runner and courier instead of an actual combatant) because every available professional soldier is needed at the <a href=""/wiki/Nakdong_River"" title=""Nakdong River"">Nakdong River</a>. The rest of the student-soldiers have not even fired a weapon. One night, they repel a group of North Koreans from the <a href=""/wiki/766th_Independent_Infantry_Regiment_(North_Korea)"" title=""766th Independent Infantry Regiment (North Korea)"">766th Unit</a>, 5th Division, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/North_Korean_People%27s_Army"" title=""North Korean People\'s Army"">North Korean People\'s Army</a>. Oh Jang-beom kills one of the North Koreans. Later, while writing a note to his mother, he wonders why they have to be at war. The next day, while on patrol, they come under fire from a single North Korean sniper. Overcome with emotion, they decide to follow the North Korean. The sniper leads them to a field, where a trap is waiting. The students get <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Massacred"" title=""Massacred"">massacred</a> and take heavy casualties, however, Oh Jang-beom, Gu Kap-Jo, a rebellious and insubordinate student, and several other students survive. Kap-Jo personally stabs a commando to death, while his fellow students fight on in a one sided battle. They run into a young North Korean child soldier, and Gu Kap-Jo kills him, ignoring Oh Jang-Beom\'s orders not to shoot. The remaining students return to the school, and most of them are overcome with the horrors of war. Even Kap-Jo is visibly shaken, despite his hardened exterior. Many students had been killed. It is revealed that they killed 12 North Koreans, while losing 16 of their own. Morale is considerably lowered by the outcome of the skirmish. The scene cuts to the battlefield where the Captain of the soldiers recently stationed at the school is under attack. Later, a student soldier, Dal-Young, is captured by the North Koreans while patrolling and is interrogated for information about the schools\' defenses by Park Mu-Rang\'s second-in-command. Park Mu-Rang, a high-ranking North Korean officer commanding the 766th, then enters the tent where he is being interrogated, and gives the student a cup of water and says that to earn the enemies trust, you must use compassion. Being a father, Park Mu-Rang sympathizes with the student, and returns him to the school uninjured. When he arrives, he tells Oh Jang-Beom that in 2 hours from that point, his North Korean troops will occupy this school, and that if Oh Jang-Beom flies a white flag above the school, Park Mu-Rang would spare the lives of all the students. Remembering his orders, Oh Jang-Beom tells Park Mu-Rang that they will see each other here in 2 hours. Later, Gu Kap-Jo beats Dal-Young in front of the other students, calling him a coward and a traitor to South Korea. Gu Kap-Jo says that staying at the school is pointless and would get them all killed, and instead they should join the South Korean forces at the Nakdong River and fight and die heroically. Oh Jang-Beom says that Gu Kap-Jo is the real coward for wanting to abandon his allies and tells him to run away in a more quiet manner. Enraged, Gu Kap-Jo attacks Oh Jang-Beom and the two fight for a short time before being interrupted by a gunshot that came from Yong-Bae, who shot his younger brother, Yong-Man to put him out of his misery. Yong-Man was injured in the earlier skirmish, and ultimately would have died from blood loss anyways. The students watch as the elder brother walks away from his Yong-Man\'s dead body and tries to gather his composure. Afterwards, Gu Kap-Jo declares that he is going to Nakdong River, and leaves with his friend, Chang-Wu. Shortly after leaving, Gu Kap-Jo and Chang-Wu encounter a North Korean truck filled with supplies that was stuck in the road. They pretend to be friends of the North Korean forces and offer to help the soldiers. After successfully getting the truck unstuck, the North Korean soldiers prompt Kap-Jo with some questions, and the scene ends with the soldiers waiting for Kap-Jo\'s response.</p>', u'<p>The other students come to realize that they must work together to defend their country. They bolster their defenses. The <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Communist"" title=""Communist"">Communist</a> Commander instructs his army to set up a line of defense 1\xa0km from the school and wait for the signal to attack then. Oh Jang-beom prepares his troops for an attack. They figure out how to fire a mortar(by kicking it) and alert the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Communists"" title=""Communists"">Communists</a> that they are ready. At first, they rip the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Communists"" title=""Communists"">Communists</a> to pieces with several organized attacks including a wire trap that connected multiple grenades which detonated at the same time,and a turn-based volley of shots between two platoons of the student soldiers from behind cover. At first, it seems the scales are tipped in the favor of the students, but the North Korean forces are too many in number and are far better armed and trained, and they overwhelm the students. One student throws a grenade tied to a potato in a sling-like manner which lands inside the gunner\'s seat of a North Korean armored vehicle, killing the gunner. After the North Korean forces have taken most of the school, Oh Jang-Beom orders the rest of the students inside the building. As all hope seems lost at this point, a North Korean truck comes in from the side of the North Korean forces. In the back of the truck is Gu Kap-Jo firing a machine gun at the North Korean soldiers, as Chang-Wu drives the truck into the front of the entrance of the school, while Kap-Jo continues firing and yells to Oh Jang-Beom that they have to finish their fight later. Using the truck as cover, the students unload weapons and ammunition from the truck and bring them inside the school.</p>', u""<p>At this point, a North Korean tank pulls up and begins to bombard the building, destroying a good portion of the front, and killing multiple students in the process. Oh Jang-Beom and Gu Kap-Jo make their way into a classroom and rest and talk for a while, as they've probably realized they will most likely die. Gu Kap-Jo tells Oh Jang-Beom that he isn't actually a student, because his family was too poor to send him to school. He expresses that he has come a long way from being an orphan to a soldier. Being in the same situation of being a student soldier, Oh Jang-Beom empathizes with Kap-Jo and they have a new-found respect for each other. As the North Koreans invade the school, killing off any remaining students, Oh Jang-Beom and Gu Kap-Jo, along with Dal-Young make their way through the halls in an effort to get to the roof of the building. A North Korean soldier appears behind Kap-Jo and shoots. Dal-Young throws himself in front of Kap-Jo taking the fire, saving Kap-Jo's life. Dal-Young tells Kap-Jo that he has to live because he is brave and a better fighter than himself, and tells them both to go. Oh Jang-Beom and Kap Jo fight their way through the halls and make it to the stairs where they meet up with Chang-Wu and another student. Chang-Wu tells Kap-Jo to hurry up the stairs and Kap-Jo tells him to meet them on the roof. Once on the roof, Oh Jang-Beom and Kap Jo set up in the front-center of the roof with some sandbags and several machine guns in a last-ditch effort to kill the North Koreans. They kill a good amount of North Koreans before a tank fires at the roof, throwing them back and dazing them. Park Mu-Yang sees the two on the roof and makes his way into the building to finish them off. At this point, nearly all the students except for Oh Jang-Beom and Kap-Jo are dead.</p>"", u""<p>Oh Jang-Beom and Gu Kap-Jo cover both entrances of the roof, taking turns reloading the mounted machine gun, and watch each other's backs. As North Koreans seem to pour out of each entrance, the mounted machine gun jams, and Oh Jang-Beom is shot in the upper-right chest area next to his shoulder, knocking him back momentarily. In this instance, the soldiers entering from Oh Jang-Beom's side shoot Kap-Jo in his lower back, the back of his leg, and arm. Kap-Jo, fueled by his hate for the North Koreans, stands up and continues to fight alongside Oh Jang-Beom and they kill the remaining soldiers on the roof.</p>"", u""<p>At the same time, Cpt. Kang Suk-Dae and his South Korean infantry reinforcements arrive at the school, and begin to clear the area of the North Koreans. Afterwards, Jang-Beom collapses from exhaustion. Gu Kap-Jo gives Oh Jang-Beom a quick smile as an acknowledgment of the respect between them, when Jang-Beom then sees Park Mu-Yang exit the stairs and onto the roof. As Jang-Beom stares in horror, he is unable to warn Kap-Jo because of his injuries, and cannot find the strength to speak. Park Mu-Yang calls out to Kap-Jo, who turns around and is shot multiple times from Park's machine gun. Park tosses aside his machine gun and pulls out his pistol and approaches Jang Beom, when he is grabbed by the leg by Kap-Jo. Although severely injured, and on the brink of death, Kap-Jo continues to fight, grabbing his signature knife and attempts to stab Park in the leg. Park then finishes Kap-Jo. As Jang-Beom watches in horror, unable to move, a tear is seen running down his face as he watches Kap-Jo. As Park tells Jang-Beom that he had wished to avoid all of this, and that the students had fought unexpectedly well. Jang-Beom subtly takes the rifle round he had saved from out of his pocket and into his rifle. Park tells Jang-Beom that all his sufferings are now at an end, as he prepares to shoot Jang-Beom, Jang-Beom then forces himself up with his last bit of strength and they fire at the same time. Park had shot Jang-Beom in the back (as he had to lean forward onto his rifle to point it at Park) while it appears that Jang-Beom had shot Park in his left lung. Both are now bleeding profusely, and Park becomes enraged and points his gun at Jang-Beom again when Cpt. Kang appears from behind and shoots Park, killing him. The scene ends with Kang cradling Jang-Beom's head as Kang repeatedly apologizes for arriving too late. Jang-Beom dies seconds later. This film was made as a commemoration of their sacrifices and was released during the 60th anniversary of the Korean War.</p>""]"

Mr. Ma continues to provide instruction to Bangja, assuaging his concerns when he thinks his master may have slept with her, and pushing him to seize upon spending the night with her before his master can. Though Bangja's seduction is clumsy and his approach very tentative, Chunhyang begins to fall for him and makes love to him on several occasions. Due to his low social-standing, however, she seeks to marry Mong-ryong and enlists Bangja's help in order to make this plan a reality.</p>"", u'<p>When Mong-ryong is called away to Seoul to finish studying and take his exam he asks Bangja to recover a written promise he gave Chunhyang about marrying her.

Returning to his body, Aang battles Zuko before Katara freezes him. Before leaving to join the battle, Aang lowers the ice so that Zuko can breathe. As the battle escalates, Iroh watches Zhao capture the Moon Spirit, with which its Ocean Spirit counterpart had assumed the form of a fish. Despite Iroh\'s pleas, Zhao kills the Moon Spirit to strip all of the waterbenders of their ability to waterbend.

Acheson has spent years hunting Alexander Pearce, a lover of Elise, who owes \xa3744 million in <a href=""/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_Kingdom"" title=""Taxation in the United Kingdom"">back taxes</a>, and is believed to have received <a href=""/wiki/Plastic_surgery"" title=""Plastic surgery"">plastic surgery</a> to alter his appearance. At a Parisian cafe, Elise receives written instructions from Pearce: Board the train to <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Venice,_Italy"" title=""Venice, Italy"">Venice</a>; pick out a man; let the police believe that he is Pearce.

She spends much time with him, seeming to start a romance. Meanwhile, the police have managed to salvage the ashes of her burned note and assembled them to extract information regarding her rendezvous, as well as her ruse. Aware of her location, but not of the ruse, an informer from the police station communicates to Reginald Shaw (<a href=""/wiki/Steven_Berkoff"" title=""Steven Berkoff"">Steven Berkoff</a>), the mobster from whom Pearce stole $2.3 billion, that Pearce is traveling with Elise on the train to Venice. Shaw immediately proceeds to Venice.</p>', u'<p>Elise invites Frank to stay with her at her suite in the <a href=""/wiki/Hotel_Danieli"" title=""Hotel Danieli"">Hotel Danieli</a> in Venice. Pearce leaves further instructions for Elise to attend a ball. Elise abandons Frank, who is then chased by Shaw\'s men. While trying to escape from them, Frank is detained by the Italian police, ostensibly for his own safety, only to have a corrupt inspector turn him over to Shaw\'s men in exchange for the bounty that has been placed on Pearce\'s head. Elise rescues Frank just before he is handed over, leading Shaw\'s men on an extended boat chase and finally escaping. She leaves Frank at the airport with his passport and money, urging him to go home for his own safety.</p>', u'<p>Elise is revealed to be an undercover Scotland Yard agent who was under suspension for her suspected sympathies with Pearce. She agrees to participate in a sting operation. At the ball, as Elise tries to spot Pearce in the crowd, an envelope is placed on the table in front of her, but the man (<a href=""/wiki/Rufus_Sewell"" title=""Rufus Sewell"">Rufus Sewell</a>) disappears into the crowd. She tries to follow him through the crowd, but is stopped by Frank. Frank claims to be in love with Elise and invites her to dance with him. After the police surprise Frank, Elise reads the note. She leaves suddenly in her boat to be tailed by Shaw. Both parties are followed by the police. Frank is held handcuffed.</p>', u'<p>When Elise arrives at the destination, Shaw takes her prisoner, threatening to harm her unless she reveals the location of the stolen money. The police monitor the situation inside the rendezvous room through audio and video links. Despite Elise\'s peril, Acheson repeatedly turns down police requests to intervene with their snipers. While the police are occupied in monitoring the situation, Frank escapes from the police boat and confronts Shaw, claiming to be Pearce and offering to open the safe if Elise is allowed to leave safely. Shaw is skeptical and makes a counter offer that Frank should open the safe if he does not want to see Elise tortured by his men. Chief Inspector Jones (<a href=""/wiki/Timothy_Dalton"" title=""Timothy Dalton"">Timothy Dalton</a>) arrives at the police stake-out, overrides Acheson, and orders the snipers to fire, killing Shaw and his men. To Elise\'s obvious pleasure, Jones lifts her suspension and terminates her employment.</p>', u'<p>Acheson, receiving a message that Pearce has been found near their position, rushes to find the police have detained an Englishman. The man, Lawrence Mason, says he is a tourist following written instructions received via his mobile phone, for which he has been receiving payments. Elise tells Frank that she loves him, but she also loves Pearce. Frank then suggests a ""solution"" to this dilemma; to Elise\'s surprise, he opens the safe by entering the correct code, thus revealing that he is really Alexander Pearce. When the police open the safe they find only one cheque: It is for \xa3744 million. Acheson prepares to chase after Pearce, but Jones overrides him, reasoning that with the taxes now paid in full, Pearce\'s only crime is that he stole money from a now-dead gangster. Jones orders the case to be closed, much to Acheson\'s frustration. Frank (Alexander) and Elise sail away together.</p>']"

They celebrate with Terry's wife, Candice, and his assistant, Denise. During the party, one of Terry's employees, Ray, welcomes Jarrod to L.A., thinking he has moved there to join Terry's special effects company. During a private argument about whether or not they should move, Elaine reveals she is pregnant.</p>"", u'<p>The next morning, blue lights descend from the sky, hypnotizing anyone who looks at them. The light affects them physically, causing them to become zombie-like. Any immobilized humans are collected by the light machines. Ray is taken, but Jarrod is saved when Terry tackles him, and he slowly returns to normal. He and Terry go to the apartment roof to investigate the lights. They see large alien spaceships descending through the clouds and vacuuming up thousands of screaming people. They are attacked by one of hundreds of flying alien drones and forced to retreat from the roof. As they attempt to open the door before the alien can get them, Elaine quickly opens it from the other side and accidentally looks directly into the aliens light. The alien hypnotizes Elaine with its blue light, but Jarrod and Terry are able to save her and close the door.</p>', u""<p>Back in the apartment, Jarrod believes the open water would be a safer place, since there are no machines over the sea. They attempt to reach the marina by car, splitting into two cars: Terry and Denise in the first, followed by everyone else in the other. They encounter a bickering couple, Colin and Jen, also getting ready to flee the building. As Terry's car exits the garage it is flattened by a massive two-legged alien. Denise is killed but Terry escapes. As he begins to run he is abducted. The others run back into the garage, where they encounter another alien lifeform in the shape of a large multi-tentacled squid that takes Colin. It corners the rest of the group before the building's concierge, Oliver, slams into it with an SUV. They find Colin is still alive inside the creature. As they try to free him, the squid creature comes back to life, sucking out Colin's brain and regaining its energy. As they run back into the building, Jen is abducted.</p>"", u'<p>The next day, the United States Air Force launches an attack against the alien spaceships and flying alien drones using stealth unmanned combat aerial vehicles and conventional drone aircraft armed with air-to-air missiles. Only one stealth plane (an <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/X-47B"" title=""X-47B"">X-47B</a>) gets through the carnage and just before it gets destroyed it fires a nuclear missile, hitting the mothership. The huge detonation blows the ship apart, but minutes later as the mushroom cloud clears, the alien ship rises back into the air and begins to slowly repair itself. After Jarrod tells Elaine that the alien light made him feel powerful, he is adamant that safety must be found outside. Oliver wants to stay inside and tries restraining him. Jarrod physically starts changing as he lifts Oliver off the floor and vows that he will protect his family.</p>', u'<p>Helicopters arrive, inserting squads of soldiers. Jarrod and Elaine go to the roof hoping to catch a ride to safety. Oliver and Candice stay in the penthouse, but are found. Candice is hypnotized by the blue light and is abducted; Oliver attempts to kill a tanker alien by turning on a gas stove and igniting a lighter, causing the room to explode. The soldiers are thrown off the roof by the aliens and a squid alien attacks Jarrod and Elaine. They kill it, but with Jarrod badly hurt. They are surrounded by the aliens, so resigned to their fate, they look into the blue light, embrace and are sucked up into the mother ship as it slowly flies over the building.</p>', u'<p>A brief montage shows that cities all over the world have been overrun by the aliens.</p>', u""<p>Inside the alien spacecraft, Elaine wakes up on a pile of human corpses. Tubes are sucking human brains into machines; probes go through the pile looking for what they can find. Elaine sees Jarrod in the pile but has to watch helplessly as his brain is removed. She is probed, but left alone since she is pregnant. Elaine is transported to another chamber where other pregnant women have been sent. Meanwhile, Jarrod's brain, glowing red instead of the usual aliens' blue, is inserted into a new alien body.</p>"", u'<p>Animating the alien body, Jarrod seems to retain control, and comes to the aid of Elaine and their unborn child. He destroys the machine that is probably trying to extract the fetus. Elaine recognizes him when he caresses her belly and her head.
